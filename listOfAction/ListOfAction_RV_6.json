    "comment": "A nice black and white photo of a person smoking. The framing is nicely done; it has breathing room on the right to bring more focus on the subject. The posing is interesting, slightly slanted for an aesthetic effect.\n \n What needs improvement is the focus of the photo. The right eye is sharper than the left eye, which should be the main focal point as it grabs the most attention. The smoke is also barely visible.\n \n To improve the photo, the photographer should check their gear to see if their lens is front/back focusing. Changing the aperture size to bring the entire face into focus could also work. And finally, a darker background could make the smoke more visible.",

The photograph appears to be shot hurriedly with an in-camera flash, illuminating the boats unflatteringly.\n \n The quality of the shot is poor and riddled with noise from the high ISO setting. It's best to reshoot the scene with better settings. Since the foreground will inevitably be silhouetted anyway, expose for the sky with as minimal ISO as the camera can handle, shot on a tripod. It's okay to keep the shutter speed a bit slower to let in more light, unless the aurora borealis is moving too fast and you don't want any light streaks; then you can opt for a faster shutter speed. Once you have a good shot of the sky, you can optionally expose for the background, shoot long exposures of the lake to keep as much light as you can, and even play around with light painting to illuminate the boats. \n \n Now, having two photos with varying exposures, blend them altogether in post so that you can keep the well-exposed shot of the sky and, finally, a well-exposed shot of the foreground.",

The pink Galah (pink and grey cockatoo or rose-breasted cockatoo) spreads its wings on the branch, as if performing some kind of ritual.

    "comment": "A photograph of a golden retriever going outside the house looking a bit sad. It's strangely the opposite reaction to what a dog would do when going outside on a bright, sunny day. The subject is well-focused, with decent sharpness.\n \n The piece could work with less clutter; the pile of objects beside the sliding door should be removed. If re-shooting is possible, it's best to use a different angle to prevent any stray objects from getting in the frame. And since it's an animal with fine-textured fur, some final sharpening would suffice.",
