First, I would place the girl and dog in the middle of the image instead of being to the side. This would help balance the image. In this case, following the rule of thirds doesn't really make sense. I would also try to omit the sky from the image and have the background be completely composed of greenery. This would make the photo look more balanced and eliminate the weird fogginess at the top, which is currently detracting from the image, in my opinion. I would also experiment with positioning the subjects to get a more impressive pose. For example, have the dog next to the girl instead of directly in front.

I like how the people are just black silhouettes and there are no distracting details showing up on them. I love how the sun is melting into the surrounding clouds and sky. It looks unique and adds another layer to the photo. The sea is also well captured and in focus despite the waves moving. One small thing I would adjust is turning down the ISO a bit to improve the photo resolution. To compensate for that, the shutter speed can be increased slightly.",

The lighting is also very good, as the sun is shining brightly, but things are not overexposed in the shot. I like the depth created by the sea and mountains peaking through in the background. The only thing I would adjust is slightly decreasing the saturation, as it looks a bit over-saturated now, which is contributing to the fake look.",

The focus also needs adjusting, as the person climbing the stairs is blurred out. The object (possibly a tree?) in the foreground on the right has a cool bokeh/lighting effect surrounding it, which is nice, but it distracts from the photo as it is not very clear. If it were easily identified as a tree, it would be better. I would also suggest increasing the saturation to bring more life to the photo.",

    "comment": "This is a random street shot that isn't really well taken. I believe it was supposed to be a shot of the tram. However, the shutter speed is too slow, and the tram has motion blur. That's the same for the man in the frame on the right. I would increase the shutter speed to deal with that, as well as fix the overexposed sky and background elements. I like the positioning of the tram on the left third of the photo. The color grading is a bit off. The photo needs an increase in saturation and an increase in warmth in the white balance.",

The issue is the blur and bad focus. A faster shutter speed should be used, as well as stabilization of the camera, to fix that issue.

I think the photo could use a slight decrease in brightness. I would also reduce the greens, as the color of the background feels unnatural.
