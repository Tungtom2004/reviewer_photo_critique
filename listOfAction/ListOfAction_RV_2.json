There are also watermarks created by a water sprinkler in front of the camera.

The gold color nicely separates the subject from the creamy-yellow cloth it's resting on. However, because of the very close framing, a shadow was cast in the foreground, most likely from the camera or the photographer. The main circular item is in soft focus because the focus shifted slightly behind it. This is likely due to the lens reaching its minimum focusing distance. There are several ways to achieve the desired look and better present the subject. First, use a dedicated macro lens to achieve a closer focusing distance and capture the item in more detail. Second, step back a bit to ensure the lens is at its sharpest focus, and then crop the image in post-production to achieve the same desired result. Cropping in closer in both approaches would yield a better composition overall.",

However, although the signs help break the monotony, they also serve as a distraction in the scene—too many, too much. Going for a vertical framing and just including the main tree and the white signage, placing them at the intersecting lines and focal point in the rule of thirds, would be a much better overall composition.",

And then there's the issue of the skewed horizon, tilting to the right. To remedy this, use the camera's built-in gridlines to level the horizon.

The tall buildings and the wide-open street nicely lead the eye toward the center of the image, and the buses act as the anchor for the scene. The chaotic power lines add texture and design. However, the reddish tint, while adding to the nostalgic feel, also serves as a drawback. This cast usually appears when the photo is extremely underexposed and detail is being recovered. A good post-processing software can restore the proper coloring of the image and make the photo more vibrant.",

His blonde hair nicely matches his gray shirt. However, using high-key lighting for this portrait flattens the overall look. The strong backlighting bounces back and spills light over his right shoulder, on camera left, and darkens the right side of the frame.

Choosing a low camera angle made the grass only waist-high for her, thus eliminating it as the backdrop. The horizontal framing and loose cropping created so much empty space around her. Getting the model to face the other way, with her face behind the sun, would eliminate the chances of her squinting.

The angle nicely captured the two buildings from which the performer is coming and going, which also provided a good sense of scale. There is little to fault in the image.

The wide, open light from outside, combined with a slightly lower camera angle, nicely lit his face while still retaining details in the background. The lines and textures on his face tell a story and history. There is little to no fault to find in the photo. I suggest converting this to black and white, which would create a more dramatic image and probably convey the story better.",

    "comment": "The image had a good idea: capturing an airplane mid-flight over a field, the sea, with backlit dramatic clouds. However, immediately, the photo already looks like a bad composite. The light on the plane is coming from the right side of the scene, while the sun is directly behind it—it's so obviously inconsistent. The God rays also immediately look fake, and so do the other elements like the sea and the foreground. Creating composites takes time. Finding the right elements that use a single, common light source is the first and foremost base when choosing the elements to be composited. Then simply adjusting or tweaking minor exposures will make it more believable.",
