First, I would place the girl and dog in the middle of the image instead of being to the side. This would help balance the image. In this case, following the rule of thirds doesn't really make sense. I would also try to omit the sky from the image and have the background be completely composed of greenery. This would make the photo look more balanced and eliminate the weird fogginess at the top, which is currently detracting from the image, in my opinion.

The color grading is well done, and the negative space is well-utilized to surround the subject. The only thing I might try changing is the position of the model. Her neck looks a tiny bit unnatural in the image, and maybe having her in a different position could look better, but I think it is very good as is already.",

The background would look a bit darker, but the outcome should be much better, and the darkness could be addressed in post-processing.

I think the color choice is nice and suitable for a sunset shot like this. One thing I might try is to edit out the black object in the bottom right to maintain the layer separation in the background, but it also adds to the depth, so I wouldn't be able to say for sure until I can see both and compare.",

I also like the color grading a lot, as the orange and cyan hues contrast very well and look good together. I also like how one of the lights is shining like a star in the bottom middle. The layering is great, facilitated by the buildings. The photo is pretty perfect as is, but one thing I would like to try is moving to the right and having the camera be in the middle of the river. That would give the photo a very interesting dynamic and composition.",

I would decrease the exposure slightly to address the overexposed sky behind the trees. I would also consider keeping only the trees of similar height in the middle of the photo in the frame and cropping everything else.

It gives a good balance to the photo. I also like the contrast between the subject and the black background. I would consider adding a slight yellowish warmth to the photo. The focus on the subject is decent, as he is sharp. I also think the lighting is decent, as the subject is well-lit and nothing is overexposed.",

I would have preferred if she had her head out of the water for the shot, or if the shot was taken from underwater. The lighting is decent. The color grading could use a slight increase in blues to better sell the cool water appearance. Besides that, not much can be adjusted due to the nature of the shot.",
