        "Critique": "Abstract architecture is always arresting to look at. Focusing on a building's windows and showing it in a way that's different from how you'd normally see it is a great way to capture the audience's attention. It makes your audience think about what they're looking at.\n \n I also like how there's a horizontal line in the middle that creates a certain dimension to the image. If only we could lessen or even remove the glare in the middle. It would also be more impactful if there were fewer shadows at the bottom. Maybe find another angle where there are no other reflections and minimal shadowing. This will create a more cohesive look. With the repetitive nature of the building's windows, it gives an infinite feel in the photograph.\n \n Or even better, this photo would work really well in black and white. That way the details become more uniform and powerful.\n \n Finally, the lamp post in the middle is kind of distracting. Though it blends nicely with the building's facade, it becomes more noticeable once you see it.",

A little more zoomed out, basically.\n \n The angle works though. I like that it features the side of his face. The small smirk also makes you wonder what he is looking at.

The foreground is just right with the man slightly off-center. The waves and the sea are also rightfully positioned. Even the little peak of a harbor or rocks adds depth to the story. The man holding a newspaper, relaxed and looking out at sea, feels nostalgic.\n \n If I could edit something, it would be the overexposed part of the upper left-hand side area.

The color balance is spot on.\n \n I also love the cascading way the houses are lined up. Not in a straight line but going downhill. It's a unique way to capture the snowy hills.\n \n It's also breathtaking how the snow smoke was captured in the background. It looks so dynamic, almost like a painting. The composition is well-balanced as is. \n \n Just a minor idea, what if the snow clouds cleared out a little bit. Maybe a little more peek of the mountains would elevate the photo more.

What I mean is have only the right hand side trees be part of the photo while the entire left hand side if branch-less, just the sky, to create empty space and give more emphasis to the silhouette of the dark leaves. Right now it's too symetrical that it looks a little bit cliché.",

Using a tripod can greatly help with shooting at night. This will reduce noise and blurriness in the photo.\n \n The photograph might also be better if there was only one firework in the shot.

        "Critique": "There's a lot going on in this image, and that itself is the problem. You don't know where to focus your gaze. Is it the trees? The zipline? The man on the zipline? It's a weird angle to capture the most interesting part, which is the man and the zipline.\n \n The tree branches, especially the ones on the right, are distracting from the photo. They're almost dead center with nothing to offer the image.\n \n I think this would benefit from a symmetrical composition where the man and the zipline are shot dead center, and all the other elements—the trees, the leaves—serve as leading lines to the man on the zipline. It would also give the zipline emphasis, showcasing how long and nerve-wracking it supposedly is. Also, try to capture some distance or space between the main subject and the leading elements, perhaps showing the plants below the zipline, to emphasize the height of the zipline.",

The composition is classic: the rolling hills in the background, enough white space between the sky and the hills, the water in the foreground, and the house on the left, which adds to the story of the whole image. It's just the right wide shot, showcasing the idyllic beauty of the countryside.\n \n What I would change slightly is the space between the left edge of the photograph and the house. I would give this more space, as it looks kind of cramped right now. It would balance the photo even more to have it slightly one-fourth of the way in, and not super on the edge.\n \n Other than that, just a few tweaks on the temperature of the photo. A warmer color balance might make it pop even more.",

There's also a whole lot of white coming from her blazer. This would have been better if she was zoomed out a little bit, or have a close-up shot that focuses on her face instead of the whole upper body.\n \n It's also always advisable to have the subject do something so the photo looks more alive. Maybe have her look at something other than straight into the camera. Maybe experiment with a side angle. Right now, it a simple snapshot. Not a lot of story for the person in the picture.",

So, maybe it would be better if the mic wasn't so high up.\n \n \n \n Also, the man behind her stands a little too close to the subject, which distracts from the photo. It would be a cleaner and clearer image if it were only the woman standing.

It's right in the middle too which automatically pulls the viewer's gaze.\n \n I would lessen the contrast of the sun without losing the amazing shadows that it has created.",

They're so little you have to use your imagination a little bit. The sky seems to be nearing dusk, and the warm yellow and blue tones are captured ever so subtly. I love it. It's a moody photo.\n \n I even like the uneven block of island silhouette on the right in contrast with the long and unobstructed shoreline. It's so tranquil to look at.\n \n I would probably crop the bottom part of the image just a little bit in order to give more emphasis to the whole scene in the middle. Other than that I like it just the way it is.",

It would also work if she were slightly illuminated from the left or right, facing sideways for more drama.\n \n For bolder choices, it could also work well to go fully black and white instead.

So what we're left with are light brown trunks with very little story to tell.\n \n This needs to be a wider shot with more details included from each tree. It's best to find another angle that would show the whole tree, yet still achieve that multitudes look (in groups and in large number).

This is a good choice because the rider's peak action is up in mid-air. By shooting from below, we emphasize the height that the bicycle just achieved.\n \n The downward direction of the ground below is a great leading element that signals direction and movement.\n \n One thing, though, is to remove the annoying brown tree trunk on the left-hand side.

There are the traffic lights, the lamp posts, the fluorescent light in the stores. All of them are representative of what a nighttime scene actually looks like.

The uphill line of the green fields is a very effective leading line that highlights the idyllic scene of the rolling hills and the mountain ranges in the background.\n \n I think this could still use a wider point of view. It's fine as it is right now, but to emphasize the vastness of this greenery, I think a broader view would be fantastic.\n \n I like how the mountainside is less saturated compared to the rest of the scene. It adds depth and dimension. I would consider cropping the bottom part of the green field a little bit so there is more emphasis on the middle and upper part of the photo, which is where the main points of interest lie.",

Make sure to use the ones with the most shapes and textures rather than the whole block of it (like the one in the middle). We're trying to showcase the leaf patterns against the colorful sky, so that's the key focus of the image.",

The shadows below are also not defined enough to create interesting shapes that may frame the clouds.\n \n I suggest choosing a time of day where there is more color or more shapes to capture. This angle looks fantastic if we were photographing a meteor shower, the aurora borealis, or even the pink and orange hues of a regular sunset. So find a key element about the sky and showcase that.\n \n Second, I would find more interesting shapes, say lush leaves of trees that show a traceable pattern, if we want to frame the photo from below.

The lines and curves also lead nicely to the man in the photo. He looks really small, which gives us an idea of how huge this place is.\n \n The composition works just fine.\n \n What needs improvement, for me, is the color and saturation. These rocks have such beautiful colors and details; they're begging to be saturated. It would also help to play around with the contrast so the intricate lines and sharp edges stand out even more. It's all about how to highlight these wonderful textures.",

It's good that he is in action, which makes for a dynamic image. However, we cannot see clearly what he is working on. There should be some distance between these elements. Make sure to capture the moment when you can clearly differentiate the man, the object he's working on, and some blur of the background.\n \n And since the background is important in establishing the story of this image, a landscape photo would also work well here. It wouldn't hurt to give context since we're not sure where or what he is.",

The house looks like an old log cabin with slightly tacky, outdated country decor. He might be staying at a summer house in the mountains, based on the interiors. The pretty dining lamp lights the subject from above. It's not distracting. It is placed perfectly in contrast to the other elements in the photo.\n \n I would try to play around with the brightness here. It would be nice to decrease the brightness but keep the lamp as it is. It's more dramatic to have the lamp as the main source of light in the image. Slightly dimming the rest of the house gives more emphasis to the man in the middle.",

You can use a motion blur technique to give drama to the vehicles passing by, or you can just use a faster shutter speed to freeze the motion of said vehicles.\n \n Either way, the goal is to elongate the orientation, which gives more emphasis to the length of the road amidst the tall buildings on the side.",

I don't find it distracting. It's nice that it's implied rather than forced.\n \n I do think there's a need to adjust the sharpness, contrast, and saturation of this photo. It doesn't look as defined as it should be. It would also be nice to play around with the color temperature and see what would make the streetlights and yellow lights pop out even more. The photo just needs more definition and polish.",

        "Critique": "As pretty as these flowers are, they look misplaced in this image. I'm confused about why we have these flowers neatly arranged in the foreground, with the long shorelines as the background.\n \n These two look completely unrelated. Is it a window sill overlooking the ocean? Was it copy-pasted there? Why are they planted so randomly?\n \n For this image, the shorelines look so much more dynamic and interesting. It would have been nice if that was the main image instead. It's great to achieve depth, but in this case, it doesn't make sense. I would just cut out the flowers and focus all my energy on taking the best shot of the shoreline. It has a very interesting shape, and the angle is already perfect for showcasing the length and grandeur of the sea.",

It can be a nice stylistic choice, but it just looks like too much and makes the photo unbalanced.\n \n The colors look nice, if a tad underexposed. The composition, though, needs more work. There's not a clear subject in sight. The midline section is too sparse to see anything of interest.\n \n There needs to be a focal point, something or somewhere the eyes can hold on to. The light reflecting in the water looks interesting, but it's too haphazard right now.\n \n What I suggest here is to find the balance between the sky and the sea. Make the most interesting one bigger. The land area in between needs to feature elements that provide interesting silhouettes, say coconut trees, a house, a lighthouse, etc. Something that would look fascinating as a shadow.\n \n I would also adjust the saturation on this.

It can be an artistic effect that signifies a more dreamlike vibe, or it's totally unintentional and the photo needs increased sharpness and contrast. I think it's the former here.\n \n With her hair loose, the print on her shirt, casual bracelet, and bright nail polish, she looks like an island girl.

Her hair is particularly in focus, but as far as I'm concerned, the main subject is still the woman's head.

Right now, it looks more underexposed than anything else.\n \n Also, the composition isn't well-balanced. The boats don't fully pull the viewer into the scene, as they look too small and random. I suggest finding a different angle where there's a bigger boat or two in the foreground, which could act as the main anchor of the photo, surrounded by more boats all around it. So the shooter needs to come closer, unless he or she has a great zoom lens.\n \n I would also consider the horizon, as it usually becomes the midline section of a photo like this. When the sun is about to set, use a tripod to capture the ever-changing skyline and see what you like best. It should add interest to the image, not distract from it.

This subtle adjustment would enhance the overall harmony and make the scene more engaging.\n \n It's also nice to straighten the middle ground (the island with the trees). The photo would look so much more polished than its current tilted version.",

There's the natural light and the glare of the computer screen.\n \n If the photographer wanted to focus on the stuffed toy, he/she should use a shallow depth of field to isolate the main subject and blur the rest of the background. If it is a work table scene, we should see the rest of the furniture—basically, a complete interior shot.\n \n But for particular objects, it's best to isolate the image or put it in a place that looks natural. For a stuffed toy, possibly with other toys or in a cabinet. This gives a much better concept and a more coherent image.",

Aside from being dangerous, it can also cause lens flare or overexposed photos.\n \n It's recommended to try to filter the sun using the natural elements around it, like the island, the clouds, or the trees.\n \n In this example, I would wait until it doesn't look too harsh anymore. Wait until it has moved downwards a little bit and try to see how it reflects off the water instead. The man could also be in motion, like walking away instead of just standing.",

For example, the horizon could be tilted more to the left so we'll have a straight vantage point. That immediately gives the photo more balance and cohesion. Right now it's imbalanced because all the elements are flushed to the right. It looks heavy on the right side.\n \n The colors and the tint look beautiful in an old, seafarer kind of way.

        "Critique": "The scene looks beautiful, but the composition needs a lot of work.\n \n The angle is problematic because it doesn't have any leading lines to guide the viewer to the subject or the most interesting elements of the scene.\n \n The bare branches of the trees look amazing, but they aren't utilized effectively here. They would have worked beautifully to frame the image. I can also see the men on the side fishing. I think it would be better if the camera were closer to these subjects.\n \n A fishing scene would look great in this background. The photographer needs to come closer and try to incorporate the water, the branches, and the riverbank in the photo. I would shoot this from the side, or even from the back, mostly focused on the men fishing.",

Have it occupy a large portion of the frame and make sure the lights pop out. Try to use a small aperture and fast shutter speed so you'll capture the details.\n \n If it's delicate, thin, and broad, maybe experiment with shooting from below.

Although I like that it's not a totally clear reflection like most shots that incorporate this style. I like that it's more implied than a clear mirror image. It's subtle and suggestive.\n \n However, to achieve a clear reflection, make sure all your camera settings are correct. Usually, this type of photography uses a small aperture and a fast shutter speed. Another trick is to focus on the reflection in the water rather than the real subject. Usually, the camera already picks up the subject closest to it. So when you try to set your focus, set it to focus on the water instead, so it gives you more chances of having a clear reflection.\n \n I also suggest giving some breathing space on the right-hand side of this photo. This can be achieved by stepping back a little and including more of the scene. Right now, there is also a distracting black entity on the right-hand side that needs to be edited.",

I appreciate the creativity.\n \n Now, on to the execution. I find that the composition looks awkward. There seems to be a reversal here, as the foreground contains all the tall elements while the background is smaller and shorter. It's anticlimactic for the viewer.\n \n I also don't agree with where it's cropped, especially the bottom part of the image. There is no clear angle or framing that guides the eye to where the image starts and ends. It's just that the buildings are sprouting in a random manner.\n \n I think a portrait orientation could help narrow down the scope of this scene. It will also give some much-needed focus so that we see a more cohesive version. Choose which buildings to highlight in this scene.\n \n Make sure to enhance the sharpness and contrast so there is definition among the buildings. The light is a bit overexposed here, so that also needs some toning down. If it has to stay in landscape orientation, I suggest tilting the camera downwards to include more of the buildings' lower portion.",

The sun has set, and we have a night lamp in preparation for nightfall.\n \n I also love how the trees in the background frame the lamp nicely.\n \n The image is blurred, but I don't think this scene calls for crystal-clear images. It's a mood shot, and you can sometimes get away with a little blur. It's just a fact that in an incredibly low-light situation, only a tripod would yield clear and sharp images. I think a few tweaks in sharpness would greatly improve this image.",

If it's the people we're after, we need to shoot people in their element. Any person can be a good subject so long as it's clear to you what you're trying to capture in them.\n \n But this whole scene combined looks too busy.

Try to bounce it off a wall or ceiling to diffuse the light. You can also use a flash diffuser so it doesn't hit your subject in a harsh manner. Better yet, if there is ample natural light, just stick with that, especially if you are shooting people. If it's an event and you can set up a tripod, you can do that too. A tripod allows you to shoot with a slower shutter speed while keeping the camera steady.\n \n Also, if it's a solo photo like this one, a portrait orientation looks far more flattering, unless there's a reason to use a landscape orientation, such as highlighting another element within the scene.",

The road at the center of the image would balance the scene very well.\n \n In addition, the photo looks a little underexposed right now, especially on the sides.

You know what the subject is right off the bat. There are glimpses of elements in the background that give context to what is happening in this scene. If I could edit a few things, I'd start with maybe muting or slightly blurring the dumpster, just to give the image more depth.

You basically have the buildings as your main subject and the rest of the canal in the background. Another suggestion would be to shoot in between the bridges of these canals. This angle gives you access to both sides of the canal banks with the next bridge as your main highlight.\n \n The next tip is to find the best possible light at night. A cacophony of yellow and colorful lights would be infinitely more compelling than side white streetlights. Try to capture those instead so the night scene becomes more alive. Since this is night photography, make sure to use a tripod and the appropriate lens that can accommodate a fast aperture.",

She fills just the right amount of the frame, all the while letting the negative space do its thing, which is to give room and emphasis to the subject.\n \n She looks like she's pressed against a glass window or a Xerox machine, or that she's frozen inside a delicate ice cube.\n \n I wonder what it would look like if we edited the negative space into something darker or lighter. Though the current color looks just fine, it is a little dull. I'm just curious what it would look like in, say, a light-colored background, or an almost black background.\n \n The overall look is still enigmatic as it is!",

The bridge needs to go, as the subject is obviously the canoe and the people on it. Try to take a shot of them without the bridge.

Try to create some distance from it, and ensure it's still in the upper part of the photo rather than melded into one of the buildings. It would also be more flattering if the sun were positioned in one of the corners. That way, the sunlight reflecting in the water will fill the scene more than it does right now.\n \n The foreground also needs to be cropped to give more emphasis to the cityscape.

The size of the photo looks like a film strip. The windows of the train even mimic the partitions of a film strip. If we go from left to right, the way the light changes from dark to light to semi-dark again is quite poetic. Only the middle one contains the silhouette of a man.\n \n There are no distracting elements here. Everything is intentional and makes the viewers think. It's visually arresting with its dark shadows, crisp lines, and silhouettes.\n \n I wouldn't change a thing in this image.",

We have the hills in the background, the overgrown grass and fields in the middle, and slanted short fences in the foreground. I can imagine how it must have looked in full color, and it made me wish it was in full color.\n \n The main issue for me is the lack of definition and contrast in the elements of this image. There are some nice leading lines here, but because of the dull and lifeless color and contrast, barely anything registers.\n \n For black and white photos to look great, the contrast between light and dark, shadows and patterns should be incredibly pronounced. Otherwise, it will look like nothing.\n \n Better yet, just shoot this in full color. It would immediately give the scene some much-needed boost. This scene usually involves a lot of natural vibrant colors, so why not showcase that in all its glory?",

Everything in the image is a little blurred, like it's supposed to be a dream.\n \n But with the bold graffiti in the background and the woman's cheeky white dress, it just looks busy. It doesn't help that she is standing in the middle of the photo.\n \n A close-up shot of her face and torso against the colorful backdrop would have been a better choice. And since this is a portrait, it is always a good idea to achieve that coveted bokeh style, where the subject looks crisp and clear and the background fades in a creamy, blurry fashion. That way, there is ample focus on the person in the frame.\n \n Have the model do dynamic poses instead of just standing. A better awareness of what would make the silhouette slimmer, such as an elongated cross-leg stance, would make a world of difference.",

I'd much rather have the full sky in color and leave the building as is, or just go for it and have everything in monochrome. That'll look way more polished.",

The only other interesting detail is how she removed her glasses from her face.\n \n I like the color of the photo, though. It has that old cinematic feel.

        "Critique": "Why do the trees look like they are all the same? Even the water area looks strangely even. With everything at the same level, the image becomes monotonous and not dynamic at all. It doesn't help that there's nothing that stands out particularly, nor is it a wide enough shot to establish other elements in the scene other than the trees and the water.\n \n This shot needs to be wider. Try to include levels of trees. The foreground also needs to be extended. If we could add another subject to focus on, maybe a boat or a group of people, that would greatly help make this photograph more alive and compelling.",

I think the leaves look far more interesting, especially against the backdrop of the blue skies.\n \n I would simply move the perspective more to the left and have a larger portion of the frame feature the leaves. You can definitely still include the trunk and the branches, but make sure the leaves fill the frame more. It's also a better idea to leave some negative space—in this case, the sky—so that there is some airiness and some breathing room for the eye.",

It has beautifully captured how the sun's rays look when passing through a filtered section, such as when sunlight hits a sheer curtain.\n \n It's also impressive to see the trees reflected in the water, and the way the shadows of the rocks and possibly leaves scattered throughout the water look so striking.\n \n If I had to make a few tweaks here, I would expand the upper part of the photo where the sky is, just so there's a bit more breathing room for the image.

I'd much rather see something that truly resembles the grass and the landscape in a realistic way. This one is too dark and somber.",

He's eating, but he's also looking at something below his watch? And why this particular color scheme?\n \n I wish we could see more of his facial features. I also think the background looks too colorful, while at the same time, it feels unsure of the subject's connection to the backdrop. He looks like a cutout right now.\n \n This would greatly improve if the background was changed. Eating an apple is interesting enough. The hand looks distracting more than anything. Adjust the light around his face so we could actually connect with it.",

        "Critique": "I like how expansive it looks. It's a wide shot of a beach scene, and it's a good choice to have it shot this wide.\n \n The wide shot works so well here because it gives the audience a snapshot of what it actually feels like to be at the beach. It's broad, and it has an unobstructed view of the horizon. The stillness of the waves lulls you, and there are many entities peppered all around.\n \n Here, the color of the setting sun in its last few minutes was captured beautifully. The pink, purple, and orange hues fill almost half the frame. I like how the lines on the sand pull you into the picture. I also love how the car's headlights in action were captured here ever so subtly.\n \n The composition is fantastic as it is. I also appreciate the straight midline section. It makes the photo look pulled together. Fantastic shot! I wouldn't change anything major about it.",

The cherry blossoms, as pretty as they look, have occupied almost three-quarters of the scene.

The topmost section is cropped out of the scene.\n \n This would look better as a wider shot, giving the audience a broader view of the whole bridge. A slightly side view would also help emphasize the height of the left rails a little bit. And if there is some kind of water nearby, why not include that in the scene to give it a little more interest because the colors right now look one-note and rather dull.\n \n I would also be wary of the possible overexposure here. Harsh light also creates harsher shadows. It can be utilized creatively. As the sun changes positions throughout the day, the left rails can create longer shadows that would look cool for the photo.",

It's nice to see an implication that this place is busy and people are going in and out.\n \n Since the natural lighting hits the horse directly, it can make the colors and textures look washed out. I would lower the brightness on this one and adjust the saturation so the colors would be more defined. It would be a good idea from the start to get your ISO at a lower setting and have a mid-range, shallow depth of field to let the subject stand out.",

I wish the foreground had the same effect; even a slight indication of a leaf frame would immediately make the photo look more balanced.\n \n As a suggestion for other ways to highlight this place, I think it would be a good idea to find a focal point, or something that is not leaves, and make that pop out in the image amidst this scene. Because even though the greenery looks nice and pretty, it can get overwhelming in the image if there's no anchor for the viewer.",

The freeze motion technique was captured so perfectly in this shot. They almost look separate from the entire background, but in a good way.\n \n I love how the rider's legs and feet are so high up. It gives such a nice balance to the way the car is in a slightly upward tilt. The background is also nicely blurred out. Even with the busy pattern, it still managed to highlight the main subject of this photo. But if there's a way to blur it out even more, I'd do that just so it looks more clean and polished.\n \n Great shot overall!",

It doesn't have to be super symmetrical. You can even play with the composition and perhaps use only one side to highlight the building. But again, give it space on the sides. Lastly, the foreground begs for the same space. Make sure it looks grounded, like the eyes land somewhere that anchors the gaze. This photo lacks that grounding frame.\n \n The color is also too warm. It makes the facade look washed out in pale yellow.

There's nothing inherently wrong with including them in a photo, but I think it would look more polished if the shot did not include those annoying pipes in the top part of the room.\n \n Also, try to capture the two ladies in a more graceful stance, still mid-action, where they really look in sync or like they're mirroring each other. That significantly makes the photo more impactful. I love how bold the colors are between the walls and the dancers.\n \n One last thing is the lighting.

It seems like the filter is intentional and there is nothing wrong with it, but I find the photo a little too underexposed right now.",

        "Critique": "The chosen angle is not flattering for the model; it flattens her features. You can't see her limbs or her figure, and the color of her hair and dress also meld together. There's also no context or additional contrast from the background. It's simply white.\n \n Since she seems to prefer the side view angle, why not do that instead of the top angle? Have her look to either side and highlight only one of her eyes so there's a little bit of mystery and intrigue. Elongate her body by making longer lines using her hands or her legs. She can also cross her legs or arms for a more angular effect.\n \n The exposure needs to go down a notch. Her face is too white right now. Let her natural olive skin shine instead. A shallow depth of field also looks best when shooting portraits of people, so that can also be applied here.",

        "Critique": "If the goal of the photo was to highlight the beer, it does the job, but it needs a lot of improvement.\n\nCurrently, the image feels too cropped, limiting the viewer's ability to appreciate the entire bottle and its details. A vertical shot could provide more space, showcasing the bottle in its entirety and adding a sense of elegance.\n\nImproving the clarity is essential, and adjusting the focal length can sharpen the image, highlighting the intricate textures and labels on the bottle. Additionally, enhancing the colors to highlight the beer's rich hues would add vibrancy and appeal, making the photo more inviting. By refining these elements, the image could transform into a captivating visual that not only highlights the beer but also invites viewers to savor its essence.",

It could be the peak of sunrise or the golden hour right before dusk. I love how the photographer has managed to filter the light amongst the trees, yet still effectively illuminated the entire scene in a very realistic and dramatic way. The light has dimension here. From the very end, it goes from dark to progressively bright. The gradient is fantastic, the way it's filtered through the trees, giving way for fantastic shadows both up and down the scene.\n\nThe big, wide road also serves as an effective leading line that guides the viewer's gaze throughout the image.\n\nTo nitpick, I would probably crop the foreground just a little bit so the visual weight doesn't get too heavy in this area, but overall, it's a really powerful image!",

It looks very uneven.\n \n The composition also appears chaotic yet flat, lacking a clear focal point. There are just too many elements in the scene.\n \n Focusing on the people walking in the middle of the street would have provided a clearer, more compelling subject. The goings of the passersby evokes the hustle and bustle of city life. So in this scene, take a tighter shot of the people in the middle. Focus on a couple of them, all the while still considering how they interact or connect with the existing background.\n \n Make sure to adjust your camera's exposure level. Outdoor shots in this very bright light require low ISO, a small aperture, and a fast shutter speed. If you want to focus on a subject and blur the background a bit, you need to adjust the aperture and make it bigger, then adjust the shutter speed to complement the possible extra light coming from the wide aperture.\n \n If the light is as bright as this, it would be nice to go for bolder colors.

It's like a cool photo from the past, though I doubt that's the case since the man on the table has an iPad.\n \n I also found it fascinating how the three people in the photo are placed in three different areas of the room, and all three are at different levels—one is standing, and the other two are sitting down but at different heights. They have covered all areas of the space, which divides the visual weight perfectly in this scene.\n \n I wouldn't change much in the photo. It looks great as it is. If I had to nitpick, I wish the TV screen, which is the focal point of their eyes, was a tad brighter or clearer. It's a little too inconspicuous right now.",

Those frames are also effective in highlighting the little girl's eyes.\n \n The tight shot works great here! It emphasizes the girl's big emotions. She looks to be about in the toddler stage, and it's that stage where little kids are definitely known for the big emotion era.\n \n The overall image looks sharp and clean, while the colors and lighting look very natural on her.\n \n Although the landscape shot works just fine, I think a portrait version would be better.",

It would be nice to see a profile of him instead of just his ears.\n \n Right now, the image is underexposed. We see mostly just black from his head down to his neck. It's important to find your light and have it illuminate your subject in the most flattering manner. Here, a better light should have grazed the left side of his cheek. This way we could actually see his facial features, even if it's in profile.\n \n Additionally, reducing the blur in the background could enrich the scene. It would be nice to have a slightly clearer view of the beach's beauty. It doesn't have to compete with the main subject, just a touch of definition so that there's an alternative focal point, allowing viewers to appreciate both the subject and the beach landscape.",

However, the image suffers from blurriness and haze due to the camera's distance, which diminishes its impact.\n \n Without a clear focal point, the viewer's eye struggles to find a subject to focus on. The mountainside on the right side of the image doesn't add any value and is too distracting from the overall composition.\n \n On the positive side, the distant field and mountain introduce a lovely blue hue that adds depth to the scene. One improvement for the image would be to shoot from a different angle and use a telephoto lens. In doing so, the mountain in the middle could be more focused and sharper, creating a more engaging and visually appealing image.",

I would suggest finding an angle where the shadows of the trees look more unique and refined. See the middlemost tree in this image. Imagine having that peppered all throughout the scene.\n \n Another suggestion would be to highlight those tree shadows instead. Meaning they would actually fill more of the frame instead of the sky.

The sun is out, and you can see the subject clearly.\n \n However, this would be better in landscape or a regular portrait orientation. It would look better if the whole tree was in the picture, or at least almost all of the tree. If it's a vertical orientation, it's fine to have it in the center of the image. If it's in landscape, you can include a few more elements to create a story out of a scene, perhaps children playing in the background, or a house, or a portion of the pavement with grass and flowers. It would be better if you utilized leading lines like walkways, roads, and fences that guide the viewer throughout the image—basically a whole scene instead of just a tree flushed at the leftmost corner.\n \n I'm also bothered by the washed-out clouds here.

And because of the harsh sunlight, the railings also add contrast by producing these linear shadows along the main subject.

It might be a good idea to adjust the brightness so the shadows would stand out more.\n \n Even better, this type of photo works great in black and white.

        "Critique": "Great use of bokeh effect here! I love how the white flower is isolated from the background. It creates such a creamy blur that mimics the softness of the white flower. It's amazing how graceful the green branch sprouts in the opposite direction.\n \n As good as it looks, I think it would be even more interesting if there was more than one white flower. Since the flower looks so delicate, a group of them would look more striking. We can see there are a few more in the background that could be included in the image. Even one more white flower would elevate the scene.\n \n Since it's mostly a soft and airy photo, I would tweak the sharpness of the flower just a little bit—not overdone, just enough to give it more definition in contrast to the blurry background. The colors could also be enhanced to make the whites pop a bit more.",

I could argue that it gives context to the size and length of these waves in contrast to how small the man looks. However, the placement is making the photo heavy and unbalanced.\n \n Surf photography can be really challenging because not only are you focused on the movement of the surfer, but you also have a lot of other natural elements to contend with, like the water, the waves, and the sun's natural lighting. But mostly, the waves. It takes a lot of practice to make sure you catch it at the right moment vis-a-vis the surfer riding the wave.\n \n Here, I think it would look so much better if we could see more of the green waters. Right now, everything is marred by the foams of the waves.\n \n The surfer is also positioned in the far right corner of the frame, almost out of the frame. Given how big the waves are, he is just swallowed by all the elements. He should be closer to the center of the image and would look so much better if he was on a more dynamic, balancing stance.",

        "Critique": "I can see the intent here. It seems the photographer wanted to use this small crevice as a frame for the tropical view outside. Sounds really clever! However, the execution needs work.\n \n First, there is way too much foreground here. Almost half of the frame gives space to this dark sand. The light was not utilized properly. From this angle, there is very little light, which means the photographer has to compensate with the camera settings, all while balancing the main scene, which is the one in between the rocks.\n \n The key here is to have better lighting within the area that you are shooting, in this case, in the foreground area. There has to be a better light source. Or you can get closer to the crevice and make it the frame of your image, but be wary about the size of this framing. Try to balance it with the scene you are trying to capture at the center of the crevice.\n \n Another suggestion would be to step back and have a wider shot overall. Make the crevice a part of a bigger scene, but also highlight that there is another scene inside the crevice, like a scene inside a scene kind of image.",

Those little hazy halos make the photo look soft and airy.\n \n The branch captured on the lower left side of the image needs to go.

I think it'd be more charming if the cat's body language wasn't so distanced from the subject. Maybe change the cat's position so it can rest its head on the woman's upper shoulder area.",

Try to balance the light and color of this area so it doesn't look as powdery.\n \n The landscape orientation works just fine, as it obviously wanted to focus on the full expression of this child.

In a shot like this, it's usually just shadows that we see from this area because the light is at the back of the scene. It then creates these beautiful shadows, which nicely contrast the colorful hues of the sky at this time of day.\n \n The photographer was able to make the foreground shadows look visually balanced and interesting. The visual weight is evenly distributed. There's a higher, pointy tree that I can actually recognize. As far as I can see, it's a pine tree. It's taller than the rest. The other levels are shorter and have different patterned leaves.\n \n The colors are also gorgeous! I also appreciate how clean and clear the colors are presented. And finally, a hint of the moon up above, perfectly placed in the upper middle part of the image, is such a charming touch!\n \n I think this scene would also look fantastic in landscape orientation.

I also notice how there's great variation in the green shade here. Some trees have a very deep green color, while others look lighter and even yellowish, which, again, is gorgeous to see!\n \n And the thing is, this is exactly how it looks in person when you are out in the mountains. If you hike, you know the fog gets heavier the higher you go. This particular instance is captured in this image in a very acute way.\n \n The only thing I would probably change is the size of the foreground.

The scene looks perfect to me right now; however, I think a little breathing space around the edges of the photo would look fabulous. It'll give the photo some negative space, which is a respite from the hectic market scene. This goes for both the right and left sides, as well as the bottom or foreground.

        "Critique": "The color of the flowers is the true highlight of the photo. The natural bright pink definitely grabs the viewer's attention right off the bat.\n \n The image is also sharp. You can see most of the details in the main flower—from the texture of the petals, to the stigma, and even the ant inside the pistil.\n \n I think this would look even more striking if the main, big petal filled up a large portion of the frame. That way, it is really in your face. For flower photography, a blown-up shot like this works well because there's a lot of details to showcase. This can even be cropped into portrait orientation so you have a full-blast view of the petals. Then you simply edit the contrast, color, and sharpness so it looks bold and striking from top to bottom and side to side.",

It's bright—a little too bright—and warm and arresting all at the same time.\n \n I like how the silhouettes of the people in the foreground look distinct and defined from the rest of the space. They give the whole photo a story rather than just a beautiful scene. It shows that there are actually people in there enjoying this view.\n \n However, I can't help but notice that the sun's shape is distracting. It has a jagged white dot in the middle of the blinding sun. If you keep looking at it, it makes you realize that the image might actually be overexposed. The sun shouldn't look this harsh.\n \n Apart from adjusting this in post, it's important to know how to avoid this when shooting. You can simply use a lens hood to block the overpowering rays of the sun when shooting. This also limits possible lens flare, which is basically excess light that reflects and scatters inside the camera and bounces back into the image.\n \n It wouldn't hurt to dial back the brightness and warmth of the photo. Ideally, it should make the highlights and the shadows calmer and more digestible by the eyes.",

Her silver blonde hair makes her look even more cold and menacing. If that's the goal here, then kudos, as that's how I perceive this photo.\n\nHer skin color looks flattering on her, though. There are no annoying shadows, which gives full attention to the makeup—the foundation, the lipstick, the eyeliner, and mascara.\n\nHowever, I am bothered by how much this tight shot elongates her face. It makes her look more oblong than she should. Maybe a slight angle to the side would help alleviate this. Instead of a straight shot, why not angle the face a little so it cuts the frame and takes away attention from the full length of her face? Also, it would be a good idea to include more of her hair from the side. It will widen the view rather than elongate it.",

This is great because we now see the filtered version of these rays.\n\nAs for the clouds, I love how dimensional they look, thanks to the well-placed shadows around them. It almost looks like they're moving, just as they do in real life.\n\nWhat I would change here is the proportion between the water and the sky. Though I can understand why the water looks bigger here than the sky—possibly because the photographer wanted to highlight the expanse of the water—I think it should be the other way around.\n\nThe sky should fill the frame more; therefore, I would crop a little bit of the foreground here. Maybe meet halfway and have them both equally fill the frame. I just think that brings more balance to the overall visual weight of the image.",

It would also be great if you have a capable lens that can capture the details of small subjects.\n\nBut for starters, I think a side view would work just fine for this scene. It will give a better view of the length and the canopy of the mushroom.\n\nIt's great that there are a number of mushrooms present within the area. It's nice to get them all in the frame as a way to emphasize their color and unique features. Like in this image, the red canopy would look great with the green grass. You can also experiment with a top view angle to give attention to these red, dotted caps. Try to make the colors as bold as possible with contrast and sharpness.",

This serves as a grounding section for such an expansive scene, therefore it would work better if it looks polished.",

An indication of motion is fantastic for this subject.\n\nLastly, since the angle is from below, why not take a shot of the plane's side instead of under the plane?

Maybe position the chairs to the right side so we can have some breathing room from all the delightful colors. Some form of negative space to the left would look perfect.

The same goes for long exposures, which are essential for night photography.\n\nAs for post-processing, with the existing photo we have, I would definitely amp up the brightness and make sure to level the horizon as much as possible.

That way, we could see the expansiveness of the sand and the sea against the clear sky. It would have been nice to see the couple walking not too far away, all the while establishing that this is an overcast day on a huge shoreline.\n\nThere's a different kind of calming feel when there is no evident sun in the scene. This cool color tone reminds you of being in the highlands, which would have been a great vibe for this image.\n\nIf you're going to include people in the scene, make sure the viewer actually sees them, especially in an image as bare as this one.",

        "Critique": "I quite like this image. It's simple, straightforward, and crystal clear. What we see is a beautiful brown bird. The details are razor-sharp. We can clearly see the beauty of his eyes, beak, and feathers. I love how we see the pattern and vibrant color of his feathers. The background melds into a creamy blur that perfectly accentuates the main subject.\n\nIt's actually pretty perfect as it is. If I had to redo this image, I would perhaps shoot the bird in portrait orientation and include the rest of his body, probably in a wider shot that also establishes its natural habitat. Perhaps he's in a zoo or a forest. I would include the branch he's perching on, but still mostly blur the background to make sure the bird is still the main subject of the scene.",

        "Critique": "It looks like an HDR photo. I appreciate how vivid everything looks. The orange color pops, the brick walls stand out, and the cobblestone streets look gritty and grimy.\n\nHowever, composition-wise, it's just okay. I don't see anything remarkable in the way the image is composed. The people are so far out and don't really convey a story, at least not one that I can easily think of. It's a snapshot of a cobblestone street on a Tuesday.\n\nWhat I am drawn to in scenes such as this are the details that tell you how the locals live in this area. For some of the houses here, there's laundry hanging by the balcony, or old men smoking and drinking at two in the afternoon. Even the kids playing around the plaza are interesting to photograph.\n\nBut for a static image like this, it's the details that matter. Try zooming into the windows, or the facade with colored wall paints or patterns. If it's the passerby, capture what you think looks interesting in them.\n\nI just don't see much story here.",

        "Critique": "Fantastic shot of this beautiful blue bird!\n\nFirst, I love the composition here. That branch where the bird is perched is top-notch. It juts out of the frame in a very graceful way, functioning as a leading line that guides and frames the subject.\n\nThe bird is also perfectly isolated from the background, which makes him stand out. The details of the bird are razor-sharp, from the beak to the eyes to the feathers. The colors look vivid and vibrant. The way he's positioned on the right side also gives the whole image a balanced look.\n\nI wouldn't really change anything in this photo. It looks phenomenal as it is. If I had to, if I really had to, maybe I would zoom in and do a different composition altogether, with the bird mostly occupying the frame. I'd try it in portrait form so the natural shape of his body would also look even in the frame. This one is close, but a closer closeup would also look immaculate as long as the details are crisp and clear.",

        "Critique": "The photo looks bland. It's also blurry, but not in a good way. The wispy branches in the foreground and on the side of the frame don't really hold much visual interest; they look random. The two white dots in the middle look like stars, but I'm not even sure if they are.\n\nThe photo needs a different perspective. I think the shape and pattern of the tree on the right side looks more interesting than anything in this photo. I suggest making that the subject of the photo instead. Check if it has enough branches to create a wide shot with the sky in the background. It would be better if it were around the golden hour when the sun looks the most dramatic. That would probably give very interesting light and shadow that you could play with against the wispy, bare trees.\n\nMake sure to use the right camera settings depending on the light you have. If it's still bright outside, use a low ISO, fast shutter speed, and small aperture. This is just a guideline, though, as it really changes depending on the scene. This is just to make sure you actually take sharp images when you shoot because a blurry photo is almost no photo at all.",

        "Critique": "This reminds me of listing photos on AirBnB. It's like that picture-perfect vacation house that you want to rent for yourself and your loved ones. If I saw this image on AirBnB, I'd be curious for sure.\n\nAs placid as the image looks, it doesn't seem like the best shot for this location. If it's for a real estate listing, maybe it's fine, but if it were for a magazine, it could use a bit more work.\n\nThis angle doesn't do the pool justice. It's flat and uneventful. I suggest finding a high spot where you can shoot from above. Do a top shot of this pool so you can see the blue waters and imagine the depth and width of it from afar. It would also be easier to find a more unique perspective, perhaps framing it creatively with the trees and the sun chairs in the background.\n\nIt would also help if you shot in bright sunlight, one that gives the viewer the image of summer, where everything looks bright and airy. Make sure to enhance the color and contrast enough that you would want to jump into the pool yourself.",

        "Critique": "The use of a shallow depth of field doesn't quite work here. The angle is too low, and the focus is at a lower level than the rest of the background elements, making it a challenge to see what it is exactly.\n\nFor this shot to work, you need to step back a little and give it some breathing space. Compose it in such a way that we can actually see the food. A slightly side and top angle, where you can still see the edge of the table where the food is, almost always looks good.\n\nIf you insist on doing a close-up shot, try to adjust the aperture to around f3.5 or 4. It's still a shallow depth of field, but there should be definition in a larger section of your subject.\n\nIt's also good to be wary of what the food looks like. For example, this looks like chopped vegetables. There's no height to flaunt here, so a close-up side shot won't highlight anything. A top shot would work fantastically for food of this kind. If it's a stack of pancakes, you'd definitely want to showcase the height, so you do the side, eye-level angle shot.",

        "Critique": "I'm immediately drawn to the scene in the background. It's begging to be shown. Or maybe that's also what makes this image powerful: not everything needs to be seen. A little mystery is also a powerful story.\n\nAlthough, I have to say, the middle part of this image has some deep shadows that bring so much depth to the scene. I love how the foreground features short, stiff, brown grasses, and as you progress further into the picture, you get another level of greenery—this time, much taller and greener pine trees. Everything looks great up until this point. Then the level halts. Your eyes would love to see another level up from this progression, and that, I think, is where the photo needs work.\n\nI think it would be a good idea to shoot it from a higher point of view. That way, we get to include the scene in the background. I think the levels work wonderfully here, but the last part should have been the mountains hovering above.\n\nIf there's no way to get to a higher angle, any element that would rise above the mountains would make this scene a bit more balanced. Even a more pronounced cloud formation would work wonders.\n\nBut as I've said, the photo still looks good because it has depth and dimension more than anything else.",
