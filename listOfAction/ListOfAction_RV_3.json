    "comment": "Abstract architecture is always arresting to look at. Focusing on a building's windows and showing it in a way that's different from how you'd normally see it is a great way to capture the audience's attention. It makes your audience think about what they're looking at.\n \n I also like how there's a horizontal line in the middle that creates a certain dimension to the image. If only we could lessen or even remove the glare in the middle. It would also be more impactful if there were fewer shadows at the bottom. Maybe find another angle where there are no other reflections and minimal shadowing. This will create a more cohesive look. With the repetitive nature of the building's windows, it gives an infinite feel in the photograph.\n \n Or even better, this photo would work really well in black and white. That way the details become more uniform and powerful.\n \n Finally, the lamp post in the middle is kind of distracting. Though it blends nicely with the building's facade, it becomes more noticeable once you see it.",

Immediately, you can create a story behind the image.\n \n The rule of thirds was also greatly utilized here, with the main land just a little off-center in the frame. It looks well-balanced. The contrast of the dark and white space and the peeking light of the stairs is absolutely arresting. The isolation of the person walking away from the stairs evokes an emotional connection with the viewer.\n \n The photo doesn't really need improvement; it's perfect as it is. However, if there's a chance to tweak it a little, perhaps extend the top portion a bit more to create an even nicer balance of white and dark tones from all sides of the photograph.",

The lack of vibrant colors doesn't help either.\n \n The textured shadows featured in the building's facade have a lot of potential and could have been dialed up a bit more to achieve more impact.\n \n You can remove the distracting tree branch at the top right to make it feel cleaner. If the photographer can increase the wall at the bottom, that would work as another layer to frame the overall image.\n \n Lastly, making the photo black and white instead of colored can have a great impact. The massive scale of the building can be highlighted more if done without colors. After making it black and white, the photographer can adjust the contrast and shadows to achieve a more dynamic image.",

They're almost dead center with nothing to offer the image.\n \n I think this would benefit from a symmetrical composition where the man and the zipline are shot dead center, and all the other elements—the trees, the leaves—serve as leading lines to the man on the zipline. It would also give the zipline emphasis, showcasing how long and nerve-wracking it supposedly is.

There needs to be more space up top so we can at least elongate the subject a little bit. It's still an interesting choice of angle because you are assuming the same position as the pet. Plus points for that. I just feel like it should have more breathing space up top to make the photo balanced.\n \n Finally, the bokeh effect could have worked quite nicely here.

There's no point of view, and the subject falls flat.\n \n What I would suggest is a black and white macro shot of just the texture of this tree branch. Think of a close-up shot of an egg tray.

It looks like she's floating or that she's a cutout.\n \n To improve this photo, I think the other people in the background can remain but be blurred out to highlight the main subject. Or they can be completely removed, and the main subject can be photographed somewhere that will still give context to where she is. Basically, have the subject interact with her surroundings or with the people she's surrounded by.\n \n For portraits of people, it's always nice to use the bokeh effect, which is achieved by using a wide aperture for a shallow depth of field.

The height goes from tall to short from left to right, perfectly capturing the curves and lines of this beautiful building.

There's also a nice pop of yellow in the middle windows that provides such a playful detail.\n \n Though I wouldn't really change anything about this image, a few tweaks in the sharpness could make the photo look even more polished (if that's possible).",

He looks grim and menacing.\n \n What I would suggest here is to turn this into a portrait image.

Such incredible depth in this photo.\n \n I also appreciate the shape of the swamps. They curve with direction, giving not only a charming detail but also providing leading lines that pull you into the image.\n \n And let's stop and appreciate the shades of green in this image. What fascinates me is that it's not an overbearing shade at all. It's vibrant, yet not in your face. It's totally cool and soothing.\n \n Finally, I love how there are pops of pink flowers on the lower left side.

It'd be nice to see her facial features up close. The pose is okay, but quite limiting. She's closed off rather than dynamic.\n \n The haze effect could go both ways. It can be an artistic effect that signifies a more dreamlike vibe, or it's totally unintentional and the photo needs increased sharpness and contrast. I think it's the former here.\n \n With her hair loose, the print on her shirt, casual bracelet, and bright nail polish, she looks like an island girl. I just wish her pose connected her more to the background. She could be basking in the sun or running on the shoreline. Movement, or even an implication of it, makes for a lively portrait shot.",

It's a closeup shot of just this woman's face.\n \n It's cool how the stencils were drawn in such a way that underlines her facial features—curved bows around her eyes and dainty strokes around her lips. The more you look at it, the more there appears to be a dust of neon green all over her skin. It's an arresting photo, especially how the woman's eyes are so prominent in the frame.\n \n I would most likely edit down the saturation a notch. The photo is too saturated.\n \n It would also be interesting if she would pull back a little and choose a feature to highlight instead of her whole face.

Though it does have a different effect, like the shadows of the boats, I think when the sun was a little higher, this scene was lit in a more interesting way. Right now, it looks more underexposed than anything else.\n \n Also, the composition isn't well-balanced. The boats don't fully pull the viewer into the scene, as they look too small and random. I suggest finding a different angle where there's a bigger boat or two in the foreground, which could act as the main anchor of the photo, surrounded by more boats all around it. So the shooter needs to come closer, unless he or she has a great zoom lens.\n \n I would also consider the horizon, as it usually becomes the midline section of a photo like this. When the sun is about to set, use a tripod to capture the ever-changing skyline and see what you like best. It should add interest to the image, not distract from it.

From there, we can see her face and her whole body against the black backdrop. I'm not so sure about the black on black, though. It could work, but it could also result in this woman looking like a floating head and limbs.\n \n Alternatively, a side shot could emphasize the two flowers while softly blurring her face in the background. This approach could create a captivating contrast between the flowers and her expression, bringing a unique artistic touch to the image.\n \n By experimenting with these angles, the photo can transform into a more visually striking image.",

It gives us an idea of what the surrounding area looks like. There's even a peek of the ocean, which is impressive.\n \n The stair handle in the foreground is a nice leading line that leads the audience to the rest house.

It's a stark white light that makes the colors look a little dull. Since the subject is using a film camera, I'd suggest finding somewhere that has better natural lighting.

Right now it's imbalanced because all the elements are flushed to the right. It looks heavy on the right side.\n \n The colors and the tint look beautiful in an old, seafarer kind of way.

Try to find a pattern that looks similar throughout, unlike here where there are long posts and then one big crisscross on the right.

A photo from the car's rearview mirror can look really cool with the right angle and the right composition.\n \n In this case, the angle feels too cramped, and there are a lot of distracting elements that obscure the intended subject. Although, as it stands, the subject is also not clear here. Is it the backyard? Or is it the skeleton sticker?\n \n I think the first challenge here is to actually find an interesting subject. Since there's very little area to showcase, it's ideal to choose something expansive and not easily swallowed by all the other elements in the image. Basically, you're trying to frame a scene inside another scene.\n \n It's usually more impactful if it creates an iteration, like the sun setting reflected in an open road and also reflected alongside the bigger picture. It's also tricky to achieve that \"fits-the-whole-puzzle\" look, where the reflected image is part of the bigger image. This type of composition needs a lot of practice and experimentation, but that's also what makes it really fun!",

    "comment": "The baby's eyes here are incredibly captivating! Talk about baby blue eyes!\n \n However, the overall image looks faded. It's too soft, though I understand this stylistic choice as an ode to the baby's angelic and fragile state. However, I think it's a little overdone. She almost looks unreal.\n \n A little definition around her head, her hair, and brows could make this photo more powerful.\n \n I'd also prefer if her ears weren't cut off. It can still be a closeup shot, but with ears. It looks weird without the ears. It's alright if you don't include the whole ears, but at least a peek or two would do.",

    "comment": "Not really sure why this looks tilted. I know it's a chandelier, but the choice to frame it in this cramped manner doesn't make any sense.\n \n The chandelier is a source of light on its own. It's very detailed and usually comes in big, ostentatious sizes like this one. I agree that it would be nice to capture it in low light where the chandelier's own light would actually stand out. But in this case, the shot doesn't do it justice.\n \n The first consideration would be the size and shape of the chandelier. If it's huge like this one, I would make it the centerpiece of the photo. Have it occupy a large portion of the frame and make sure the lights pop out. Try to use a small aperture and fast shutter speed so you'll capture the details.\n \n If it's delicate, thin, and broad, maybe experiment with shooting from below.

    "comment": "Great shot overall!\n \n Reflection photography usually involves a clear reflection of the landscape to depict symmetry.\n \n The reflection is almost there. Although I like that it's not a totally clear reflection like most shots that incorporate this style. I like that it's more implied than a clear mirror image. It's subtle and suggestive.\n \n However, to achieve a clear reflection, make sure all your camera settings are correct. Usually, this type of photography uses a small aperture and a fast shutter speed. Another trick is to focus on the reflection in the water rather than the real subject. Usually, the camera already picks up the subject closest to it. So when you try to set your focus, set it to focus on the water instead, so it gives you more chances of having a clear reflection.\n \n I also suggest giving some breathing space on the right-hand side of this photo. This can be achieved by stepping back a little and including more of the scene. Right now, there is also a distracting black entity on the right-hand side that needs to be edited.",

You can see the texture, the height differences, and the deep and shallow areas as evidenced by the number of shadows in it. You can see the texture, maybe not in a closeup way, but from afar.\n \n Then there's the stark blue sky from above that looks like an alien has just landed. There are even very tiny beings who seem to be walking in the direction of the light—very interesting details, but also very tiny.

The more you look at it, the more they look like miniatures, maybe because it was shot from a top angle. Instead of the usual from-below shot, this one makes the buildings seem small and toy-like. I appreciate the creativity.\n \n Now, on to the execution. I find that the composition looks awkward. There seems to be a reversal here, as the foreground contains all the tall elements while the background is smaller and shorter. It's anticlimactic for the viewer.\n \n I also don't agree with where it's cropped, especially the bottom part of the image. There is no clear angle or framing that guides the eye to where the image starts and ends. It's just that the buildings are sprouting in a random manner.\n \n I think a portrait orientation could help narrow down the scope of this scene. It will also give some much-needed focus so that we see a more cohesive version. Choose which buildings to highlight in this scene.\n \n Make sure to enhance the sharpness and contrast so there is definition among the buildings. The light is a bit overexposed here, so that also needs some toning down. If it has to stay in landscape orientation, I suggest tilting the camera downwards to include more of the buildings' lower portion.",

I even like how her paws are resting. They have levels. One is outstretched, and the other is closed off. The way she's leaning gives a lot of attitude, just like how cats really are.

This results in what you see in this photo: a white halo, dot, or haze in the resulting image.\n \n There are a number of ways to avoid this, and the most common is a lens hood, or you can even simply use your hand over the lens to block the sunlight. Or, you can change the angle so it doesn't hit the lens directly.\n \n In this case, I would also change the angle of the camera. Try not to have the sun dead center in the photo.

Her eyes are almost squinting, so there's not much to glean from there.\n \n In terms of color, I like how the orange complements the camouflage pattern of the rock.

The series of orange dots amidst the dark blue sky looks so interesting, but again, it's blurred and not in an intentional kind of way.\n \n To avoid this much blur, always consider the scene you're trying to capture. If it's a nature scene like this—a sky, to be specific—a capable wide-angle lens is best. If you don't have that, just make sure that your camera settings are correct: low aperture, fast shutter speed, and ideally a low ISO, depending on the light you currently have. This allows you to take sharper photos of things that are far from your camera lens.\n \n If this wasn't blurred, I would also add some negative space in this image—something that would break the whole branches-in-the-sky scene because it looks too heavy right now.

    "comment": "There's nothing wrong with bold colors in an image. However, this one looks unflattering because of the stark white lighting. It looks like the photographer used flash here, or possibly the subject was lit by fluorescent light, and it directly hits his face in a harsh way.\n \n If shooting indoors, don't point the flash directly at your subject. Try to bounce it off a wall or ceiling to diffuse the light. You can also use a flash diffuser so it doesn't hit your subject in a harsh manner. Better yet, if there is ample natural light, just stick with that, especially if you are shooting people. If it's an event and you can set up a tripod, you can do that too. A tripod allows you to shoot with a slower shutter speed while keeping the camera steady.\n \n Also, if it's a solo photo like this one, a portrait orientation looks far more flattering, unless there's a reason to use a landscape orientation, such as highlighting another element within the scene.",

The dark shadow area on the bottom left provides great contrast to the light area that fills almost three-fourths of the image. Even the two people descending the stairs add just the perfect amount of drama. They're a little blurred, like a motion blur, which is perfect.\n \n One comment I would have is that I wish the two people in the scene were slightly farther apart; then it would give this part a bit more definition than it has right now.

The asymmetry doesn't quite work here because there is only one road, it's empty, and it's vast. The best approach is to embrace that fully and have it dead center to emphasize its vastness.\n \n The surrounding elements also contribute to this idea of expansiveness: the barren flatlands at the side of the road, the straight white line in the middle, and the massive, almost translucent quality of the mountain ranges from afar. The road at the center of the image would balance the scene very well.\n \n In addition, the photo looks a little underexposed right now, especially on the sides.

Although there is a reflection on the water—and it looks pretty spot on—the whole scene still looks super busy and dark.\n \n I think a different angle should be explored here, one that doesn't make the scene look tilted.\n \n A front angle would work just fine. You basically have the buildings as your main subject and the rest of the canal in the background. Another suggestion would be to shoot in between the bridges of these canals. This angle gives you access to both sides of the canal banks with the next bridge as your main highlight.\n \n The next tip is to find the best possible light at night. A cacophony of yellow and colorful lights would be infinitely more compelling than side white streetlights. Try to capture those instead so the night scene becomes more alive.

    "comment": "Great closeup image of these gigantic cactuses!\n \n First, I love the contrast of these green succulents against the deep blue color of the sky. It makes the image pop in all the right ways. The low angle shot also makes them look tall and massive! I can also see the details of the cactus, the red spikes, and the curves and ridges.\n \n I think the photo would look even better if there was a bit of breathing room on the top and side of the image, just a little bit. Nothing crazy. I like how it was shot in portrait orientation. It's a tight shot, but it serves a purpose, which is to have all the attention on the cactus and highlight its height and texture.\n \n I suggest also adjusting the brightness just a tiny bit. It is slightly overexposed right now. It works just fine since it indicates the scorching heat of the sun, but a few tweaks would just make the photo more polished.",

    "comment": "I don't think it's ever a good idea to exclude someone's neck in a tight face shot. He looks like a floating head, and it's not flattering.\n \n I also don't agree with the landscape orientation here. This image begs to be shot in portrait orientation. It would include just enough of his head, maybe neck, and chest so we could actually see him better. It also immediately gives an illusion of length rather than looking stumped.\n \n I appreciate the blurred background since it highlights the subject better. However, we can't get anything from this photo apart from the side of his face—no eyes, no expression, no neck. We don't have a clue who he is or where he is.\n \n For portraiture, we are trying to capture someone's personality in the image, and one of the best ways to do that is to have them interact or show emotion via their eyes, which, sadly, is extremely shrouded here.",

The trees are basically obscuring the building in the background, and since the flag is also in the frame, I would think it's really about the building. Right now, it doesn't make much sense.\n \n This is not the correct angle for taking the best wide shot of this building. I get the artistic decision to obscure it amidst these evergreen trees; however, the trees from this angle are as tall as the rest of the building, so it obviously wouldn't work.\n \n If the goal here is to highlight the flag, a nice zoom lens would make the job easier.\n \n Personally, I would take a standard shot where the building is in full view, along with the flag, unobstructed.

Make sure your lens is set to a fast shutter speed and a wide aperture to let in more light. It takes a lot of practice to anticipate the peak moment of an action scene, so the old adage of practice, practice, practice goes a long way.\n \n To make this photo more powerful, I would crop or remove the distracting people in the background.

It doesn't help that she is standing in the middle of the photo.\n \n A close-up shot of her face and torso against the colorful backdrop would have been a better choice. And since this is a portrait, it is always a good idea to achieve that coveted bokeh style, where the subject looks crisp and clear and the background fades in a creamy, blurry fashion. That way, there is ample focus on the person in the frame.\n \n Have the model do dynamic poses instead of just standing.

It's a very close-up shot, and it's quite sharp for what it is. It's not being prettified. You can see the grime and everything.\n \n I would for sure tone down the light here, but again, I think that defeats the purpose.

It's a good detail to note because it gives the viewer context on how huge this temple is. Look how small the people look in contrast to the red structure.\n \n Lastly, the colors and saturation need some tuning here. The photo looks a little dull, or rather, unedited. Adjusting the color, brightness, and contrast would make sure that the red building would stand out impressively against the evergreen background.",

It doesn't help that there's nothing that stands out particularly, nor is it a wide enough shot to establish other elements in the scene other than the trees and the water.\n \n This shot needs to be wider. Try to include levels of trees. The foreground also needs to be extended. If we could add another subject to focus on, maybe a boat or a group of people, that would greatly help make this photograph more alive and compelling.",

There also appears to be a kind of lens flare, that shadowy, hazy light that casts the trees in the image. However, this kind of flare works fantastically for this image. It has beautifully captured how the sun's rays look when passing through a filtered section, such as when sunlight hits a sheer curtain.\n \n It's also impressive to see the trees reflected in the water, and the way the shadows of the rocks and possibly leaves scattered throughout the water look so striking.\n \n If I had to make a few tweaks here, I would expand the upper part of the photo where the sky is, just so there's a bit more breathing room for the image.

It's nice to see an implication that this place is busy and people are going in and out.\n \n Since the natural lighting hits the horse directly, it can make the colors and textures look washed out.

I wish the foreground had the same effect; even a slight indication of a leaf frame would immediately make the photo look more balanced.\n \n As a suggestion for other ways to highlight this place, I think it would be a good idea to find a focal point, or something that is not leaves, and make that pop out in the image amidst this scene.

It doesn't have to be super symmetrical. You can even play with the composition and perhaps use only one side to highlight the building. But again, give it space on the sides. Lastly, the foreground begs for the same space. Make sure it looks grounded, like the eyes land somewhere that anchors the gaze. This photo lacks that grounding frame.\n \n The color is also too warm. It makes the facade look washed out in pale yellow.

Perhaps capture the way the snow envelopes the pine trees. Try to experiment with new perspectives, not just the eye-level kind of angle. If there's a chance to get a top view from an upstairs window, do that. The snow-covered trees would look good from above, too.

Yes, the tree trunk where the bird's nest lies is placed in the middle, but it somehow just makes the photo look awkward. All the greenery below doesn't really do anything for the photo.\n \n If the goal is to take a photo of the nest, you need a special zoom or telephoto lens that gives you the focal length needed to blow up the main subject without getting close.\n \n And I don't think it's enough to shoot just the nest; the birds would be a great addition to the scene too. This requires a bit of patience for the photographer.\n \n If it was just about the trees, a complete overhaul of the composition needs to happen.

It's amazing to see how the reflection looks soft and blurred while he himself looks quite sharp in contrast. It's disorienting in a good way!\n \n I also love how he positioned himself in the scene. He sits right at the empty space where the house and the trees frame him perfectly.\n \n My suggestion here is to enhance the brightness just a little bit.

Try to find another angle that would capture all three in a more balanced way, say from the side, but more on the front view of the boat. This can include a lot of experimentation. The goal is to showcase all three in a way that's clear and in harmony with each other. Even a view from the front would work quite nicely here. Just make sure they are at the same levels.\n \n Second, if possible, try to capture this when the light looks great, say first thing in the morning or right around sunset. It gives instant interest to the image.\n \n Try to minimize as much background clutter as possible. Use a shallow depth of field to isolate the subject of your image.",

I think this photo would look more compelling in monochrome—why not just have the scene in blacks, grays, and whites?\n\nI would also declutter the middle part of the image.

Don't overcrowd one corner of the frame, or if you do, make sure there's another side that has more negative space to compensate for the visual weight.\n\nI like the blurred background here, but I think it could be dialed up a notch. \n\nIt's also a good idea to rearrange the bottles and have them on the side instead of at the back because it makes them look like they are actually a part of the punch bowl.",

It could be the peak of sunrise or the golden hour right before dusk. I love how the photographer has managed to filter the light amongst the trees, yet still effectively illuminated the entire scene in a very realistic and dramatic way. The light has dimension here. From the very end, it goes from dark to progressively bright. The gradient is fantastic, the way it's filtered through the trees, giving way for fantastic shadows both up and down the scene.\n\nThe big, wide road also serves as an effective leading line that guides the viewer's gaze throughout the image.\n\nTo nitpick, I would probably crop the foreground just a little bit so the visual weight doesn't get too heavy in this area, but overall, it's a really powerful image!",

    "comment": "Street photography aims to capture the dynamic essence of urban life. While sidewalks offer a fantastic backdrop, achieving a balanced composition is key.\n \n In this instance, the photo suffers from overexposure, with excessive brightness on the right side contrasting sharply with darker shadows on the left. It looks very uneven.\n \n The composition also appears chaotic yet flat, lacking a clear focal point. There are just too many elements in the scene.\n \n Focusing on the people walking in the middle of the street would have provided a clearer, more compelling subject. The goings of the passersby evokes the hustle and bustle of city life. So in this scene, take a tighter shot of the people in the middle. Focus on a couple of them, all the while still considering how they interact or connect with the existing background.\n \n Make sure to adjust your camera's exposure level. Outdoor shots in this very bright light require low ISO, a small aperture, and a fast shutter speed. If you want to focus on a subject and blur the background a bit, you need to adjust the aperture and make it bigger, then adjust the shutter speed to complement the possible extra light coming from the wide aperture.\n \n If the light is as bright as this, it would be nice to go for bolder colors.

I understand the haze is the main vibe here; however, a little definition on the tree branches, or even having different levels of the trees, would give a more dynamic image. Right now it's all one level and blur. Too much of the blur is one step away from being totally forgettable. It's fine to have this mood, but a little sharpness and definition wouldn't hurt.",

As dark as this picture is supposed to be, the light was captured perfectly, allowing you to clearly see the most important elements of the scene.\n \n The whole composition captures the joy of the event. The lanterns look big and willowy above, while the people are cramped and bustling down below. The dark undertones contrast beautifully with the orange hue brought by the lanterns' natural light.\n \n If I could nitpick this photo, I find the little lanterns—the ones that look like mini stars from afar—to be too cramped on the upper left part of the scene. In contrast, there is only one little lantern on the right side. It would have looked more balanced if this could be evened out, and the little lanterns were also present on the right side of the frame.\n \n Also, the big blocks of black shadows on the foreground can be a bit distracting. This should be minimized, if possible. Maybe it would be better if the foreground could be cropped just a tiny bit.

This angle will also give a worm's eye view of the crane, making it prominent for dramatic effect.\n \n Second, the photo can remain as is, but the crop can be increased so the frame will be square.

Upon closer inspection, this makes sense because, based on the bicycles around the room, this place is more or less a shop for bike riders.\n \n The use of black and white makes the photo look old and classic. It's like a cool photo from the past, though I doubt that's the case since the man on the table has an iPad.\n \n I also found it fascinating how the three people in the photo are placed in three different areas of the room, and all three are at different levels—one is standing, and the other two are sitting down but at different heights. They have covered all areas of the space, which divides the visual weight perfectly in this scene.\n \n I wouldn't change much in the photo. It looks great as it is. If I had to nitpick, I wish the TV screen, which is the focal point of their eyes, was a tad brighter or clearer. It's a little too inconspicuous right now.",

It leads the eye into the photo, including the beautiful way it curves downwards. That's a fantastic way to showcase depth. And because of the harsh sunlight, the railings also add contrast by producing these linear shadows along the main subject. The end result of the crisscross pattern looks really cool.\n \n What I would enhance here is the contrast and brightness of the image. I'd play around with how much deeper to achieve a bolder, sleeker look. It might be a good idea to adjust the brightness so the shadows would stand out more.\n \n Even better, this type of photo works great in black and white.

I could argue that it gives context to the size and length of these waves in contrast to how small the man looks. However, the placement is making the photo heavy and unbalanced.\n \n Surf photography can be really challenging because not only are you focused on the movement of the surfer, but you also have a lot of other natural elements to contend with, like the water, the waves, and the sun's natural lighting. But mostly, the waves. It takes a lot of practice to make sure you catch it at the right moment vis-a-vis the surfer riding the wave.\n \n Here, I think it would look so much better if we could see more of the green waters. Right now, everything is marred by the foams of the waves.\n \n The surfer is also positioned in the far right corner of the frame, almost out of the frame.

    "comment": "I can see the intent here. It seems the photographer wanted to use this small crevice as a frame for the tropical view outside. Sounds really clever! However, the execution needs work.\n \n First, there is way too much foreground here. Almost half of the frame gives space to this dark sand. The light was not utilized properly. From this angle, there is very little light, which means the photographer has to compensate with the camera settings, all while balancing the main scene, which is the one in between the rocks.\n \n The key here is to have better lighting within the area that you are shooting, in this case, in the foreground area. There has to be a better light source. Or you can get closer to the crevice and make it the frame of your image, but be wary about the size of this framing. Try to balance it with the scene you are trying to capture at the center of the crevice.\n \n Another suggestion would be to step back and have a wider shot overall. Make the crevice a part of a bigger scene, but also highlight that there is another scene inside the crevice, like a scene inside a scene kind of image.",

It then creates these beautiful shadows, which nicely contrast the colorful hues of the sky at this time of day.\n \n The photographer was able to make the foreground shadows look visually balanced and interesting. The visual weight is evenly distributed. There's a higher, pointy tree that I can actually recognize. As far as I can see, it's a pine tree. It's taller than the rest. The other levels are shorter and have different patterned leaves.\n \n The colors are also gorgeous! I also appreciate how clean and clear the colors are presented.

It appears to be a hard light, but it illuminates the flower parts in vivid detail. If you zoom in, you can see how delicate the white petals are.\n \n I can imagine this in landscape orientation. I think if it were in horizontal form, we could see the flower zoomed in, and its whole petals, wide open, would be accommodated without any problem. I want the whole flower to fill up the whole frame; it makes the flowers more gigantic, more striking than it is right now.\n \n I would also dial up the color and saturation because a macro photo like this would look phenomenal with vibrant, saturated colors.",

    "comment": "It's incredible to see how the colors get lighter as you get farther out of the frame. It starts in this deep green color, and the fog slowly shifts the whole texture of the image. It's such a nice contrast of bold versus barely there. I also notice how there's great variation in the green shade here. Some trees have a very deep green color, while others look lighter and even yellowish, which, again, is gorgeous to see!\n \n And the thing is, this is exactly how it looks in person when you are out in the mountains. If you hike, you know the fog gets heavier the higher you go. This particular instance is captured in this image in a very acute way.\n \n The only thing I would probably change is the size of the foreground. I would try to extend the green area a little bit more so it's a tad bigger than it is right now.

The sunlight is reflected on the white umbrellas and the conical hats. Second, the frame is filled to the brim! It is crowded and narrow and incredibly busy. And third, the two colorful canopies on the top part of the image work well in framing this scene.\n \n If I had to change something here, I would probably zoom the camera out just a tiny bit. The scene looks perfect to me right now; however, I think a little breathing space around the edges of the photo would look fabulous. It'll give the photo some negative space, which is a respite from the hectic market scene. This goes for both the right and left sides, as well as the bottom or foreground.

This also allows you to include the structures on the right side of the frame.\n \n The current photo feels like the buildings are cut off, so moving to the left side gives more room to include them.\n \n Lastly, the colors look dull and muddled.

    "comment": "There are a lot of things going on in this photo. There's the fence, the grass behind the fence, the jagged rock, and, of course, the lizard. What it lacks is focus. Instead of having all the elements in focus, it should just be the lizard.\n \n First, the lizard is too far out of the rock. It should be resting mostly in the middle, ideally facing the camera, or at least almost facing the audience. Second, the position should be more central. Better yet, it should be a tighter shot where the lizard is zoomed in and focused. Lastly, the background should be minimal. It should simply give a slight indication of where we are, not necessarily a full view. This can be achieved simply by isolating the subject and having the background blurred out.\n \n As for this lizard, it should be a tight shot with the goal of highlighting its features—the skin, the eyes, the tail, the mouth. The more vibrant and sharp it is, the better.",

I also don't see it contributing to the main subject of the image, which is the woman standing.\n \n And since we can see the light in front of her, that part of the image is a tad overexposed.

The goal is to keep the light, just not an overpowering white cast.\n \n If I had to reshoot this, I'd do a tighter shot of the woman's face up to her waist. Depending on how harsh the light is, try to capture the way it graces her face, possibly use a mid-range aperture since there's a lot of light, but you still want to blur the background a little bit.

It's bright—a little too bright—and warm and arresting all at the same time.\n \n I like how the silhouettes of the people in the foreground look distinct and defined from the rest of the space. They give the whole photo a story rather than just a beautiful scene. It shows that there are actually people in there enjoying this view.\n \n However, I can't help but notice that the sun's shape is distracting. It has a jagged white dot in the middle of the blinding sun. If you keep looking at it, it makes you realize that the image might actually be overexposed. The sun shouldn't look this harsh.\n \n Apart from adjusting this in post, it's important to know how to avoid this when shooting. You can simply use a lens hood to block the overpowering rays of the sun when shooting. This also limits possible lens flare, which is basically excess light that reflects and scatters inside the camera and bounces back into the image.\n \n It wouldn't hurt to dial back the brightness and warmth of the photo.

Her silver blonde hair makes her look even more cold and menacing. If that's the goal here, then kudos, as that's how I perceive this photo.\n\nHer skin color looks flattering on her, though. There are no annoying shadows, which gives full attention to the makeup—the foundation, the lipstick, the eyeliner, and mascara.\n\nHowever, I am bothered by how much this tight shot elongates her face. It makes her look more oblong than she should. Maybe a slight angle to the side would help alleviate this. Instead of a straight shot, why not angle the face a little so it cuts the frame and takes away attention from the full length of her face? Also, it would be a good idea to include more of her hair from the side. It will widen the view rather than elongate it.",

    "comment": "Is this the best possible angle to highlight the features of this mushroom? I don't think so.\n\nThe idea is definitely there! For something this small and low, it's a bit of a challenge to photograph because you have to get down there too. It would also be great if you have a capable lens that can capture the details of small subjects.\n\nBut for starters, I think a side view would work just fine for this scene. It will give a better view of the length and the canopy of the mushroom.\n\nIt's great that there are a number of mushrooms present within the area. It's nice to get them all in the frame as a way to emphasize their color and unique features. Like in this image, the red canopy would look great with the green grass. You can also experiment with a top view angle to give attention to these red, dotted caps. Try to make the colors as bold as possible with contrast and sharpness.",

An indication of motion is fantastic for this subject.\n\nLastly, since the angle is from below, why not take a shot of the plane's side instead of under the plane?

It fills the frame just right, leaving enough space on the left and right sides so it's a little bit isolated as the main subject.\n\nSince it's in black and white, I get why there's a need for saturation. Not only does it emphasize the lines and shapes in the car, but it also gives it a vintage look. But perhaps not at this level of saturation. I would dial this way down.

    "comment": "It's a panoramic view of a harbor shot at night. There's a lot of potential here, but I think the execution needs work.\n\nFirst, the image is underexposed. You have to squint to see the details of the boats and buildings, especially on the right side. Second, although there are light reflections on the water, most of them are shapeless. There's not much definition there, which lessens the intended effect. Also, the way the image is composed, the sizes of the boats and the buildings just look random and busy with no clear rhyme or reason. It's not visually balanced. In the darker areas, they just look clumped together.\n\nSince this is a panorama shot, it's very important to use a tripod to prevent camera shake, which will definitely affect the sharpness of the final image. Also, with the tripod, you'll have more leeway to lower your ISO, even at night. The same goes for long exposures, which are essential for night photography.\n\nAs for post-processing, with the existing photo we have, I would definitely amp up the brightness and make sure to level the horizon as much as possible.

    "comment": "The sudden pops of color give a lot of interest to the audience. However, I feel like the choice of portrait orientation is not the best. I understand it gives the tall tower more room to be showcased, but since it's already a wide shot, you can definitely accommodate the height of this tower in a landscape orientation.\n\nThe reason I feel like this would work better in landscape is that there are other elements in the photo that give context to this very tall structure. A horizontal view would give more space to fully accommodate the scene.\n\nTake, for example, the green pool in the foreground. It would look so much better if it was extended, filling the frame from end to end. Since the buildings are in somber colors, this pop of green actually works well to contrast the dullness.

It juts out of the frame in a very graceful way, functioning as a leading line that guides and frames the subject.\n\nThe bird is also perfectly isolated from the background, which makes him stand out. The details of the bird are razor-sharp, from the beak to the eyes to the feathers. The colors look vivid and vibrant. The way he's positioned on the right side also gives the whole image a balanced look.\n\nI wouldn't really change anything in this photo. It looks phenomenal as it is. If I had to, if I really had to, maybe I would zoom in and do a different composition altogether, with the bird mostly occupying the frame. I'd try it in portrait form so the natural shape of his body would also look even in the frame. This one is close, but a closer closeup would also look immaculate as long as the details are crisp and clear.",

    "comment": "The photo looks bland. It's also blurry, but not in a good way. The wispy branches in the foreground and on the side of the frame don't really hold much visual interest; they look random. The two white dots in the middle look like stars, but I'm not even sure if they are.\n\nThe photo needs a different perspective. I think the shape and pattern of the tree on the right side looks more interesting than anything in this photo. I suggest making that the subject of the photo instead. Check if it has enough branches to create a wide shot with the sky in the background. It would be better if it were around the golden hour when the sun looks the most dramatic. That would probably give very interesting light and shadow that you could play with against the wispy, bare trees.\n\nMake sure to use the right camera settings depending on the light you have. If it's still bright outside, use a low ISO, fast shutter speed, and small aperture. This is just a guideline, though, as it really changes depending on the scene. This is just to make sure you actually take sharp images when you shoot because a blurry photo is almost no photo at all.",

If it's for a real estate listing, maybe it's fine, but if it were for a magazine, it could use a bit more work.\n\nThis angle doesn't do the pool justice. It's flat and uneventful. I suggest finding a high spot where you can shoot from above. Do a top shot of this pool so you can see the blue waters and imagine the depth and width of it from afar. It would also be easier to find a more unique perspective, perhaps framing it creatively with the trees and the sun chairs in the background.\n\nIt would also help if you shot in bright sunlight, one that gives the viewer the image of summer, where everything looks bright and airy.

Compose it in such a way that we can actually see the food. A slightly side and top angle, where you can still see the edge of the table where the food is, almost always looks good.\n\nIf you insist on doing a close-up shot, try to adjust the aperture to around f3.5 or 4. It's still a shallow depth of field, but there should be definition in a larger section of your subject.\n\nIt's also good to be wary of what the food looks like. For example, this looks like chopped vegetables. There's no height to flaunt here, so a close-up side shot won't highlight anything. A top shot would work fantastically for food of this kind.

I love how the foreground features short, stiff, brown grasses, and as you progress further into the picture, you get another level of greenery—this time, much taller and greener pine trees. Everything looks great up until this point. Then the level halts. Your eyes would love to see another level up from this progression, and that, I think, is where the photo needs work.\n\nI think it would be a good idea to shoot it from a higher point of view. That way, we get to include the scene in the background. I think the levels work wonderfully here, but the last part should have been the mountains hovering above.\n\nIf there's no way to get to a higher angle, any element that would rise above the mountains would make this scene a bit more balanced.

The sun is filtered on the right corner of the windshield.\n\nThe light looks so cinematic. It could be a film still from a road movie. The road scene here is amazingly well-lit by this golden light. You can see the horizon, the yellow fields, the cars in front, the blue sky, and, of course, the wide open road. The composition of the framed scene is fantastic. I like how the inside of the car looks dim in contrast to the scene outside. It perfectly highlights it. And I love that you can still see the rearview mirror on the right, reminding you that this is, in fact, from the inside of a car.\n\nI can see some of the dirt reflected on the windshield, as well as some minimal lens flare at the bottom center of the frame. While some may prefer to clean this up, I think it looks appropriate for this image. These imperfections add more charm and make it look like a candid capture.",

    "comment": "This is most likely a film capture based on the marking Ilford HP5 Plus.\n\nThe image is underexposed. It's dark and murky. There is also a very noticeable lens flare, or possibly the direct image of the sun, in the upper middle section of the photo.\n\nComposition-wise, it's clear to me what the subject is: a huge tree with a gazillion branches. It's nicely positioned in the left-hand corner of the frame, which is a great position to give it a balanced look.\n\nFor film photography, we rely on the camera settings alone and have no chance to see the product as we shoot. It's important to take note of your film's ISO because there's only so much you can adjust, depending on the film camera you're using.\n\nAs a standard rule, when shooting a very bright image outdoors, you can get away with a lower ISO, like in this scene. However, you should make sure that it also works well with your aperture and shutter speed. A very fast shutter speed with a small aperture will let a very small amount of light in. Try to familiarize yourself with the film camera's light meter to ensure your photo will be properly exposed.\n\nThere is some charm to vintage, hazy photos. Like in this underexposed photo, yes, it's far from crystal clear, but it's definitely nailing an eerie effect.

The straight wooden plank immediately leads the eye to the center of the image, and it's a very clean line.\n\nThe photographer has employed some HDR editing, which makes the details extra sharp and saturated. The sun is beautifully placed on the right side of the image, and the clouds—look at those clouds—are perfectly scattered in these perfect cumulus shapes.\n\nThen there's the yellow handrail and the mini house in the water. Both are flushed to the left-hand side of the image, which slightly makes it look uneven. It's quite stark, given it's in a bright yellow color. I don't think adding a similar one to the right side would help the photo; I think it would make it too cluttered and heavy. This asymmetry is looking really good the more you look at it. It's surprising and unconventional, but at the same time, the free space is a welcome reprieve for the image.\n\nJust for fun, I think without the yellow handrail, the photo becomes much more quiet.

The size of the bee in contrast to the whole frame is just perfect. You can see the bulging eyes, the wings, and even the hairy parts of its body. It gives me the shivers.\n\nThe tight shot is perfectly composed, with the bee and the flower occupying the right side of the frame in an almost slanting manner that's visually pleasing with the way it's angled in the flower. The blurred background is also spot on. It makes the subject stand out even more.\n\nIf I could nitpick, maybe I would adjust the shadows a little bit and make them a tad deeper. I think it would help give more depth to these areas of the photo.\n\nOtherwise, it's a perfect image!",

Though I like how she is spread throughout the frame, I think cutting her legs out of the frame doesn't do her figure any favors.\n\nFirst, I would change the location of the whole image, to be honest, and find somewhere where there is some gorgeous lighting. If you insist on being in the shade, find an area that at least gives some shadows that you could play around with.\n\nTry to isolate the subject by blurring the background to give it some depth. Use a shallow depth of field so you have a sharp subject and a creamy blurred background.\n\nFor this photo, maybe the brightness can still be adjusted. Or if it's still not salvageable, turn this into a black and white photo and play around with a bolder contrast and saturation.",

There is not enough depth in the image, which looks disorienting for a portrait shot. Instead of showcasing the woman in the picture, she is competing for attention with the black rails of the window. It's distracting, to say the least.\n\nI also find her pose a bit awkward, especially because it's hard for me to contextualize who she is or what she is doing in the first place.\n\nFirst, I would dial down the overly saturated colors and give back some depth and definition to her face. Then, second, dial down the brightness and contrast so the whites aren't too harsh. We should sense the color of her dress, and the negative space doesn't have to be fully washed out.

It's the way the tree is placed in the frame: it's cut off at the upper portion of the trunk, and the shadows don't have any dimension to them. The shape is also too stiff and imposed, instead of looking natural and graceful.\n\nI think it shouldn't just be one tree. For a shadow to look more impactful, it should be a whole scene, not a solo tree, and definitely not a semi-wide shot of that tree. Either you build a scene with the pastel hues as a backdrop, or it's a zoomed-in pattern that you found interesting in the wispy branches of these trees. One is a wide shot, and the other is a closeup shot.\n\nFinally, the brightness of the colorful skies could be dialed down a little bit. In this pastel tone, the tree looks washed out. If it were in a deeper, bolder tone, maybe it would match the somber patterns of the tree branches.",

It's basically in threes, not at all symmetrical, and that's why it works!\n\nThe colors are also not exaggerated. It looks natural but still vivid and vibrant. The brightness, though I personally like it the way it is, can be dialed down just a teeny bit. It's a little too bright right now. I would deepen the saturation just a tiny bit too and adjust the warm color temperature to a little bit cool. Key words here are \"a little.\" Just a few tweaks to make it more polished.

The boat is a key part of this scene, so it should be bigger and positioned on one of the vertical lines in accordance with the rule of thirds. The rule of thirds just makes sense here. Third, the clouds could look a bit more interesting if they had shape in them. It's fine to show the gloomy skies, but at least there should be some depth to it by way of shape or shadow.\n\nYou can then adjust the brightness here while maintaining the overall theme, which is a gloomy day.

Give the middle, white part of the park more emphasis by framing it using the elements in the background. Include that one last chair in the middle a little bit more. Better yet, if you find a horizontal line, like a fence, that would frame the lower portion of this image, that would make it more compelling. The photo is also tilted to the right side. I would straighten that out so it looks more even-keeled.\n\nThen, on to the colors. Since there are a few beautiful yellow and red-colored trees around, why not make them pop more? Adjust the color and contrast so they accentuate the scene more. These tree colors remind people of the fall season, and that would be a nice feeling to anchor the scene to.",

Her eyes hit the perfect mark, and it speaks to the audience. The light looks flattering on her face and her skin color.\n\nJust a personal preference, but I think this portrait photo would look even more amazing in a vertical orientation. Not that it looks bad right now, but in portrait form, the tight shot won't spread out her shoulders as it does in landscape. It would also seamlessly include the rest of her beautiful hair and chin.",

I like how the car is placed in the frame; it looks natural. I just don't see why this scene is interesting.\n\nIf the photographer is indeed trying to paint a car wash scene, there should be more water action, right? Instead of just the remnants we see on the ground, why not capture the water falling, splashing, and dripping on and around the car? Get that motion shot so the photo looks more alive.\n\nI also see some semblance of light on the corner of the car's back end. You can use that in the image to create a more dynamic light.\n\nFinally, I think it's better to see at least the upper part of the car. It can still be the same composition, but at least extend that part a bit so it doesn't look like it was just cropped.",

Instead of a crystal-clear closeup of this bee in action, what we have is a cluttered image with the elements almost there, but not quite.\n\nI think the camera settings here play a huge part, as well as the distance of the lens to the subject. If you have a very wide aperture and are close to the subject, there's a tendency for the focused part to become way too small, and the blurry part emanates throughout the rest of the scene. It's important to find that balance of a classic bokeh shot, but in this case, in macro photography.\n\nThe flower should also be more defined here. Right now, all we see in the frame are its petals, with no other parts that would make it look more sharp and multi-dimensional.\n\nThe bee should be the main focus and should be a bit isolated from the rest of the elements in the photo, including the flower.

There were probably a lot of light sources when this shot was taken, which isn't surprising since it looks like they're at home. If they have cool lights in the area, like a fluorescent light, the camera automatically compensates for that and changes it into a warm color. That's why it's very important to adjust your camera settings depending on the available light you have when shooting.\n\nThe sharpness may have also been affected by the low light situation indoors. This could be fixed by amping up your ISO, widening your aperture, and slowing down your shutter speed, depending on how much light you actually have. That's why for low light situations, it's best if you use a tripod so you'll have more leeway for a brighter and clearer exposure.",

I also like the light reflecting a few steps from the door and further changing into a pitch-black color the farther away it gets. It shows such nice depth.\n\nI think in order to make this photo better, I would consider cropping it so that the focal point would look bigger; therefore, the door and the subject would be closer and bigger.

If the woman is the main subject here, then it would be better if she moved a little more into the frame, not necessarily in the middle, but a substantial distance so we can immediately associate her as the main subject. She's just too far on the edge in this photo.\n\nOr, have the horizon be front and center, sharp and in focus, and the woman can be almost out of frame like what we have here.\n\nPersonally, I think if there is an unobstructed view of the sun and the horizon, make it worthwhile for the audience and make sure it's in focus and sharp.\n\nApart from that, the light here has not been utilized to its fullest. There are so many dramatic lighting options as the sun sets or rises. I think it's nice to showcase its unique color as it shines over the landscape. Here, there is very little to showcase.

This wide shot gives an unobstructed view of this unique land formation. The composition is spot on. I wouldn't change a thing about it.\n\nNow, on to the colors and the contrast. The colors right now look too flat and one-note. It's mostly varying shades of blue and gray. The green trees just meld into the background. The color just doesn't look engaging. The same goes for the contrast. The sky and the dome are of the same intensity color and saturation-wise. Therefore, the overall impact is not that compelling.\n\nI think adjustments to the saturation, contrast, and colors should be made. Make the greens and the blues a little bolder. The gray area, the granite area, can be lightened a little bit. It needs to stand out against the deep dark greens of the trees and the deep blue sky. The end goal is to make the colors a lot bolder so the overall image doesn't look washed out.",

    "comment": "I think this is a good example of disrupting the pattern. I can imagine how this image would look great, at least in theory.\n\nThough we usually advise isolating the subject and blurring out the background, this is one of those instances where it would have more impact if the man at the center were still lost in the crowd and didn't have this much distance from it.\n\nI imagine him walking the same way as all the others, lost in the crowd, but he's the only one in full focus while all the others are blurred out. Even just a few steps back for this man would already make a difference.\n\nMy problem with the large gap or distance between him and the background, at least in this particular photo, is that it creates dissonance. The connection is lost. The crowd is too far away to have any impact.\n\nSince the crowd is a big part of the background, why not embrace it and have him be nearer to it?\n\nI love the lighting and the colors here.

For this particular image, the exaggerated colors and definition look great because it fits the subject perfectly. The subject here is this very lush group of trees, plants, and foliage. The HDR edit perfectly accentuates how rich and verdant this scene should be. It's perfect! That's exactly what I see here!\n\nI also like the diagonal way that the plants are lined up. It makes the overall scene more balanced and more interesting rather than a one-level height. The senses are enticed on several levels—the colors, the size, the patterns, the height; even the shadows in between look fantastic and give so much heft to the image.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the sky is slightly less saturated compared to the rest of the scene. It's actually a great contrast, so there is definitely a stress on the main subject of the image.\n\nI wouldn't change much here except for maybe slightly dialing down the brightness.",

    "comment": "The photo is underexposed with the sky overly saturated. The composition is also not well balanced. The sky occupies too much of the frame, while the buildings below look cramped and dark. The water area is also too narrow.\n\nFirst, the composition should find a balance between the three elements: the buildings, the sky, and the water. If we follow the rule of thirds, the land, including where it stands, should take two-thirds of the image, while the sky takes one third. Right now, it's the other way around.\n\nSecond, try to find a visually pleasing angle for the buildings. Line them up in such a way that gives a sense of balance and variety. Don't just clump them together. Choose the best spot to include.\n\nFinally, make sure the light is present. We can definitely lighten this in post, but as a photography principle, it's always about the light first and foremost. Make sure the subject is lit well, not necessarily bright, but illuminated in the most interesting way possible. That includes even lighting, and also dark, dramatic lighting.\n\nOnce the exposure is correct, that's when you can adjust the saturation and make it as natural or as bold looking as you want it to be.",

The trees on top look cramped in contrast to the vastness of the white snow in the middle of the photo.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with highlighting the huge snow area, as it is an interesting vantage point for this particular scene. It's a snowy mountainside, after all, and the low angle supposedly helps the snow area look massive.\n\nHowever, the composition should include a fair amount of the trees above, including a bit of the sky. A well-balanced photo will include two-thirds land and one-third sky. I would move the camera further up to include the other elements.\n\nThe exposure here also needs to be corrected. It needs to be dialed down so we can actually play around with the beautiful shadows of the trees against the sunlight. Accentuate those shadows instead.

I would have preferred it to be shot a little tighter, or simply to crop the gray foreground a bit right before the stairs. The symmetry works here because the building itself has a symmetrical design. It’s effective to have the tall facade in the middle of the photo, with a slightly lower angle, to emphasize its height and grandeur.\n \n What would make this photo stand out more are some tweaks in the contrast and saturation of the colors. The details and the outline are already there. The image is also clear and sharp. Making the colors bolder and the lines more pronounced—the blue sky, the grayish silver facade, and the orange door—would greatly improve the overall impact. This might even look cool as a black and white photo since the lines, patterns, and shadows would look heightened in a monochrome color palette.",

It looks unremarkable as you can't see much detail for the main subject of the image.\n \n The sky should have looked more appealing if it had some color to it rather than its washed-out state right now. The mountain also looks hazy, not verdant green. Even the small houses at the bottom look hardly recognizable. It could be the distance of the photographer, maybe the lens just couldn't capture as much detail as it should. A wide shot like this needs a very capable zoom lens.\n \n And the water just looks sad, and that's unfortunate because it's a huge part of the main subject. I don't see any semblance of the sea.

    "comment": "I like the subject of this photo—a top-view shot of a fish vendor selling his products. I like the idea of the shot more than how it was executed.\n \n It's important to decide which fish should be the main subject of this image. I think the fish underneath, the ones placed on a white rice sack, should be the focus because, one, there are more of them, and second, they look more interesting in comparison to the fish inside the wooden encasing. The camera should move slightly to the right so the focus would just be the small fish below. Make a more close-up shot of it while still including the background elements like the fish vendor's hands, etc.\n \n It would be interesting to make the fish in the box the main one, but it is a real challenge given how it's positioned in this scene.\n \n The best way to make this image pop is to make sure the colors are very striking, so bold colors with a high-contrast look would definitely fit this shot.",

The direction of the cracks in the rocks leads the eyes further into the picture.\n \n I wish the top part was extended just a little bit. I don't need it to be fully visible because I think the mystery of the forest is well executed here, but I think the top part, right where the man's head is, could use some breathing space to balance out the overall visual weight.\n \n Overall, it's a really unique and evocative photograph!",

Even better if they are doing different things, say, for example, one is using the mic, the other is playing the guitar, and another is working the crowd—anything that indicates variation and dynamic movement.

    "comment": "I love how the angle of this shot is different from the other photos of the Statue of Liberty. You get a sense of the massive scale of the statue when you first glance at this photo. The addition of the flag is good, as it adds some layer and depth to the photo.\n \n I also like how the color of the sky contrasts with the colors of the giant structures. The negative space at the right is fine, as it creates a kind of balance with the composition. However, I think it would have been better if the camera was moved to the right a little bit, to show more of the face of the statue.",

When you look at the photo, you'll get the sense of how the person in the photo feels—the exhaustion of studying during exam week, etc.\n \n I like how the photo was composed, showing the line of books with some papers at the top. However, the blue notebook is a little distracting, despite being blurred in the background. It would be better if it were replaced with a more neutral-colored notebook so that the focus would remain on the hand touching the book.\n \n I would also prefer if the hand occupied a smaller space in the whole frame. Right now it feels too big, and as a viewer, I would like to see more of the annotated book without much distraction.

This feels like a mistake and a distraction to the photo's composition. I think the scene can do without it.\n \n The colors of the buildings have a punchy, old quality to them. This should be highlighted by perhaps adjusting the temperature of the image. Since there's not a lot of good light to begin with, try adjusting this to a warmer tone and see if that would make the image pop out more. Since we are highlighting the lines, shapes, and patterns of the facade, the goal here is to attract the eyes with a compelling scene of these elements. So it's important to highlight them by enhancing the saturation, the color, the contrast, and even the sharpness.\n \n Lastly, building photography like this almost always works in black and white.

    "comment": "The main issue here is that there is too much blur on the main scene, while the uneventful background has sharpness and clarity instead. It should be the other way around, or at least give the eyes something to focus on. It also doesn't help that it's in a portrait orientation, which limits the space to showcase what looks like an ostentatious dragon dance.\n \n This would look way better in landscape, so there is enough room for all the major elements in the scene. Ideally, the dragon should be sharp enough to become the frame of the man in the background. It would have been great if the man was positioned in the middle of the space, surrounded by the dragon's tail.\n \n It's a challenge to capture a dance, much less a dragon dance with big props swirling in the scene. It's paramount to shoot with a fast shutter speed, as you do in sports photography, or do so in continuous shooting mode and burst mode so you'll have plenty of shots to choose from.",

The colors look dark and muddled. Her face is also blurry, almost hazy. She's wearing this pretty dress, but it's not doing her any favors because the colors are just so dull and flat.\n\nWhen shooting indoors, it's important to situate the subject where there is natural light. Any window will do. You can experiment with many directions, like side or front lighting. Back lighting has its own effects, but usually, for portraits, it's side or front light. The goal is to give the model the best possible light so their features shine in the photo.\n\nIf there's no natural light, you can use an artificial light to do the same, but make sure it has filters so the light looks soft, not harsh.\n\nTry to also isolate the subject from the background by using a shallow depth of field. Good portrait photos have a focused, sharp subject and a creamy, blurry background.\n\nTo salvage this photo, maybe try to brighten the subject and adjust the colors and saturation so there will be some. The purple dress should look purple, not off-white.",

However, because the background is too dark and the cat’s fur is also partly dark, they both meld together, making the cat look less defined and, thus, less compelling.\n\nHowever, I can also see a different concept here. Maybe the photographer was trying to capture a dark background so the cat did meld into the background, almost like it's floating, but with a few other intriguing features, like the white part of his fur and his black birthmark, standing out of the frame.\n\nIf that's the case, then the background should be almost completely dark, and therefore the slightly blue tinge in the background should be blurred out as well. It should look like he is coming out of a blackout.\n\nIf that's also the concept, it would be nice to have his eyes look more striking, with more contrast than the rest of the image.

Not even the blue skies could enliven this photo for me.\n\nSince this is a nature shot, I think the photographer should do a wider shot than this—capture a complete scene at least.

However, I'm not quite understanding why there is weird-looking foliage framing this image.\n \n I think the idea was there. It is nice and good to have some form of framing device to compose your subject. But here, it isn't as successful as it could have been because the tree branches just don't have the correct shape, or rather, that beautiful shape. Frankly, it looks like the image has mold coming to get it.\n \n This framing device would work if the trees, the leaves, the foliage had softness to them. I can imagine something like this that looks like a wispy curtain. And it would be better if there was an interesting kind of light that filtered through it so it doesn't look as heavy and bulky as it does right now.\n \n It's hard to fully give feedback to the scene in the center because of the huge distraction on the sides. But I do see that the lighting can be more dramatic here since we see there is a ray of golden sunlight coming from the right side of the image. It would be great to wait it out and have this light illuminate the rest of the scene, and that's when you take a photo. Otherwise, this light right now looks way too dull and flat.",

    "comment": "The background light here looks lovely! It's a shoreline view with the horizon and the sun either rising or setting. However, the cute toddlers in the foreground are visible, but also very dimly lit. It gives me the impression that the photographer may have wanted to really capture their faces or was going for a silhouette composition. Basically, neither was achieved in this photo.\n \n This type of lighting actually affords a lot of interesting shots if you just play around with it. I can imagine just going for a classic silhouette shot in this case where the two little kids are present in the frame but ideally in a dynamic pose, e.g., running after each other, doing a jump shot, playing around, etc. The angle will be a front angle either from a low or eye-level shot. The goal is just to get their silhouette against the glistening golden sun in the background.\n \n Another option would be to really use the sun to illuminate their faces, which means photographing them diagonally where they are lit through the side of their face. We can then include the length of the shoreline with the horizon to their right.\n \n Whichever it is, it's about committing to how to use this gorgeous light. Right now, they aren't positioned in a visually balanced way, and the kid on the right is barely recognizable with no definition whatsoever. They should have a clear presence in the frame, whether in silhouette or not.",

There's a silhouette of what looks like a naked man with streaks of light coming out of him.\n \n I don't find the image appealing. The subject is in the center, and there's a square around him, which feels like overkill in establishing the subject. The other surrounding elements are also too abstract, yet too muted to give anything hefty for the eyes to chew on. I find the colors unattractive and somber. It looks like a depiction of a dream or a man sleepwalking.\n \n How to improve the composition? Maybe if the door and the man were moved farther away and deeper into the middle of the image, then the streaks of light would look longer, thus creating a leading line in the middle of the scene. That leading line will anchor the elements in this photo so it looks visually balanced and interesting.\n \n As for the colors, it's a huge experiment.

It definitely needs some adjustments in brightness, enough to light the image properly without losing the dark dungeon theme.\n \n The composition isn't that special since the camera is always at the backside of the in-game character, so the focal point is always with that side only.\n \n The best angle here would be a straight, eye-level view of the man, following the direction of his back, and having the open door as the background image.

Try to position it in a way that it fills most of the frame in a symmetrical or balanced manner.\n \n Maybe shift the angle so you can see the corner of the building shooting up into the sky instead of just the facade.

    "comment": "I love the way the couple is interacting in this image. They look like they're into each other, and that was captured just fine.\n \n The curved line of the bridge is also a nice leading line to the subject(s) of the image. They're positioned on one of the intersecting lines, following the rule of thirds.\n \n I have to say, though, that the composition is a little off balance. The visual weight of the image is all ushered to the left side, right where the couple is positioned. The end of the curve of the bridge is there, the lush green background is also there, and so are the subjects, while the right side looks blurred and empty.\n \n It would have helped if the background of the couple was a little blurred out, too, so it doesn't feel too dense. Or, at least, dial down the exposure of the right side background so it melds with all of the other background and isn't isolated as blurred and bare.\n \n I also would have liked to see a glimpse of the woman's profile instead of just her hair. It would be great to see her eyes or her smile as she's looking at her man.",

The rock in the background looks immense as a focal point, and the grass and flowers in the foreground have so much depth and dimension that they look very realistic as a whole.\n \n The colors of the foreground are gorgeous! There are so many textures on display, and the way they are spaced out looks so balanced and visually pleasing. The points of interest are evenly distributed, even if it's not an obvious symmetry, which is even more fantastic.\n \n The only comment I have is about the definition of the sky and the horizon. It's not too bad, but it does look a bit washed out. I would slightly adjust the brightness here and dial up the contrast and see if it helps define the sky against the big boulder in the middle.\n \n Otherwise, a great landscape photo!",

It's that exact kind of blue that you'll associate with winter weather.\n \n As much as the background looks impeccable, I find the foreground to be too busy. Not only is it busy, but the bare branches that poke out of the sides of the frame look too stiff and frail to have any appeal. The pine trees scattered in the center of the image look clumped together in a way that looks heavy and clustered.\n \n I think this image would have looked better if the foreground wasn't so busy. The clustered pine trees just look unappealing. Maybe there is a different angle where they look more evenly scattered rather than clumped.\n \n I would also remove the side branches here, as they just look distracting.

The lighting and the colors look natural and well-exposed.\n \n What needs improvement here is the balance of the composition. The way their heights are spread across the frame needs a bit of work. The tall man on the left should move further into the picture so he doesn't look gigantic in contrast to the other men, or have him at a lower stance so he doesn't look overwhelming. Ideally, all three should at least look about the same height or wildly on different levels while in action. Right now, their positions and individual stances are not as varied.\n \n I would also probably choose a different angle so the image looks cleaner. I'd move the camera to the right and just take a straight photo of them, almost eye level with the fence as the main background. Or, better yet, move them towards the front of the store so there is color in the background. Try to make the people look sharper than the background scene.",

The scene is visible but could still be improved. The foreground is barely visible, which makes the scene a little hard to see. The light post in the middle looks clear, and I wish the entire scene was as defined as that light post.\n \n On the bigger frame, I find the object on the left side of the image to be unnecessary.

It's a portrait photo of a woman, and we see her profile amidst a wide-open space.\n \n The woman's position follows the rule of thirds, whereby she is placed at one of the grid's intersections. There is ample negative space to keep the photo from looking cramped.\n \n What I would adjust here is the exposure. Right now, it's a tad overexposed, especially the back part of the woman. It's not a major overexposure; just a minor change in brightness and a deepening of the contrast could easily change this to a more evenly lit image. The sunlight is illuminating her from the side, but it's not really hitting her face. It would have worked better if she moved a little bit to her left so that some sunlight would hit this side of her profile.\n \n I would perhaps crop the photo slightly, keeping its square crop but cropping from the upper left-hand side so it's not too wide-looking as it is right now.",

He's walking with his back to us, and that's it.\n \n The photographer could have utilized the background more by showing a more composed shot of the road, the passerby, and the beautiful street lights all lined up on the sidewalk.\n \n There needs to be a balanced scene for an image to work.\n \n It also doesn't help that we only see his back. He is close to the camera, so we can't help but wonder what he looks like and what expressions he has on his face. We have none of that in this image.\n \n Again, the composition needs to be changed. It should include a well-balanced arrangement of different elements, perhaps a wide shot of the road on the left, with the subject walking into it—less foreground and more towards the meaty section of this scene.",

There's a lot of negative space, and it gives such an expansive feel to the image, all the more when you notice that in the middle of the photo, right where the rock ends, there's actually a group of people hanging around. It just gives perspective to how huge this place is.\n \n But that's the thing: it doesn't feel that massive at first glance. It is wide, but I didn't feel the rock on the right side was that big. But given how the people just look like specks on it, it is definitely that big.\n \n First, it's important to straighten the horizon here so the photo looks clean and pulled together. Second, I would include a larger portion of the rock/island instead of just one-fourth of it. I'd try to fill at least a third of the frame with it.\n \n I would also crop the sea foreground slightly, so it fills almost a third of the frame horizontally, making the sky and the horizon fill up most of the upper frame. This will give a more balanced feel once the island is included.\n \n I would also tweak the brightness so the shadow of the island on the right side would deepen a little bit and give that impression of depth.

Both have a similar somber beach scene, but one is slightly cooler in tone than the other.\n \n For diptychs to be compelling, the two photos should have some form of connection, either through similarities, differences, or a common storyline.\n \n Both photos share the same somber atmosphere with low light aesthetics, blurred visuals, and a cold mood. The appearance of a woman indicates a lot of things. It could still be a continuation of this same melancholic theme, but with the addition of introspection and reflection as embodied by the woman. But honestly, it's hard to create a seamless connection because even though these two photos look similar at first glance, there is really not much that connects the two of them.\n \n On the other hand, since both photos are atmospheric, it would be nice to see a starker difference in the mood between these two photos—maybe a much warmer temperature in the right photo (warmer than it is right now). It could still be the same shoreline scene, but this time with a slight indication of seasons changing perhaps? This could be the inclusion of colors in the bare trees, the sun slowly peeking into the ocean, etc. Something more than just the woman in the photo, basically.",

I like the defined shapes of the distant clouds; they add depth and dimension to the image.

It would have been great to see more of these ripples, especially in the middle part of the water area. If that were the case, the large portion of the foreground would be justifiable.\n \n But as it stands, the visual weight is a bit off. There is too much water in the foreground, but the sky and the horizon look too short.\n \n I think the composition should include a good amount of water, ideally with the ripples more visible, and the trees and sky section need to be extended a little bit to create a more balanced image.\n \n Additionally, the distant trees could use a bit more definition rather than just seeing a dark area in the midline section.

    "comment": "I like how the image beautifully captures the forest's texture, showcasing the harmonious blend of natural colors. The greenery of the trees complements the brown leaves on the ground, creating a visually appealing scene. The natural pathways draw your eyes to the center, adding an enchanting sense of mystery to the place.\n \n As for the composition, I think I would focus on how to make the trees overlap with each other. This creates a sense of depth and dimension in the image. This is usually achieved when great lighting enters the scene, giving those coveted shadows and flares from the sun that immediately makes the forest scene ten times better.\n \n Or, if we don't have that light and angle, I would much rather have this in landscape orientation. That way we can see a more expansive view of the trees and capture the feeling of being there, rather than this limiting aspect ratio.\n \n And finally, the blurriness of the photo detracts from fully appreciating the scene's full potential. A sharper focus would have enhanced the image significantly.",

I also love the symmetrical composition here. It gives twice the punch, making the two structures look super tall and impressive.\n \n However, the image is underexposed. There is not much light here. The background is dim, and so is the sky. It's worth mentioning, though, how grand the sky looks despite the low light. It looks so expansive, which echoes the two main structures in the foreground.\n \n If only there was some solid light to illuminate this scene, it would have been perfect. Some natural light would be good, but otherwise, this can also be adjusted in post. Dial up the brightness and contrast so we can actually see the full potential of this scene.",
