        "comment": "Abstract architecture is always arresting to look at. Focusing on a building's windows and showing it in a way that's different from how you'd normally see it is a great way to capture the audience's attention. It makes your audience think about what they're looking at.\n \n I also like how there's a horizontal line in the middle that creates a certain dimension to the image. If only we could lessen or even remove the glare in the middle. It would also be more impactful if there were fewer shadows at the bottom. Maybe find another angle where there are no other reflections and minimal shadowing. This will create a more cohesive look. With the repetitive nature of the building's windows, it gives an infinite feel in the photograph.\n \n Or even better, this photo would work really well in black and white. That way the details become more uniform and powerful.\n \n Finally, the lamp post in the middle is kind of distracting. Though it blends nicely with the building's facade, it becomes more noticeable once you see it.",

I also like that the mountains are showcased in a zigzag fashion so it's not too symmetrical.\n \n The photo is balanced quite nicely, with the background hazier and lighter than the dark hues of the foreground. It's incredible to see the trees lit by the backlight. It creates fantastic depth and contrast, making the photo feel more dimensional.\n \n I would try to increase the contrast of the photo, see if it mutes the super bright light in the background, just a little bit, because as much as it looks very realistic right now, it's also a tad harsh.\n \n Minimal editing in my opinion.",

Just by looking at the image, you could feel the cold breeze through the image. The vast emptiness of the white space gives off a modern feel for a landscape photograph. The color balance is spot on.\n \n I also love the cascading way the houses are lined up. Not in a straight line but going downhill. It's a unique way to capture the snowy hills.\n \n It's also breathtaking how the snow smoke was captured in the background. It looks so dynamic, almost like a painting. The composition is well-balanced as is. \n \n Just a minor idea, what if the snow clouds cleared out a little bit. Maybe a little more peek of the mountains would elevate the photo more.

If the photographer can increase the wall at the bottom, that would work as another layer to frame the overall image.\n \n Lastly, making the photo black and white instead of colored can have a great impact.

The white space is perfectly placed in the foreground, which gives a brilliant contrast to the busy scene of the rocks in the upper left-hand side of the photo.

They're so little you have to use your imagination a little bit. The sky seems to be nearing dusk, and the warm yellow and blue tones are captured ever so subtly. I love it. It's a moody photo.\n \n I even like the uneven block of island silhouette on the right in contrast with the long and unobstructed shoreline. It's so tranquil to look at.\n \n I would probably crop the bottom part of the image just a little bit in order to give more emphasis to the whole scene in the middle. Other than that I like it just the way it is.",

It's quite beautiful, but also overpowering.\n \n Second, as I kept looking, I noticed there's a lover boat captured through the wine glass. Very clever! It's even more cheeky because this whole scene looks like a shot from someone's honeymoon. I mean, all the elements are there—the sunset, the candlelit dinner, the wine, the sea, and, of course, lovers on a boat.\n \n I think the challenge here is how to highlight the boat in the glass element. I think it should be the focal point of this image, but since it's shot in landscape, the whole scene swallows this detail.

The shadows below are also not defined enough to create interesting shapes that may frame the clouds.\n \n I suggest choosing a time of day where there is more color or more shapes to capture. This angle looks fantastic if we were photographing a meteor shower, the aurora borealis, or even the pink and orange hues of a regular sunset. So find a key element about the sky and showcase that.\n \n Second, I would find more interesting shapes, say lush leaves of trees that show a traceable pattern, if we want to frame the photo from below.

From this angle, you can see where the water is going, how strong it is, and the surrounding scenery.\n \n I would tighten this shot by minimizing the huge, unnecessary weeds on the right side of the photo. Just a few plants would work to frame it on this right side.\n \n I would also include more of the top part so it doesn't look stunted and abrupt.

The building's bold, layered colors contrast nicely with the sky's solid blue.

Though it does have a different effect, like the shadows of the boats, I think when the sun was a little higher, this scene was lit in a more interesting way. Right now, it looks more underexposed than anything else.\n \n Also, the composition isn't well-balanced. The boats don't fully pull the viewer into the scene, as they look too small and random. I suggest finding a different angle where there's a bigger boat or two in the foreground, which could act as the main anchor of the photo, surrounded by more boats all around it. So the shooter needs to come closer, unless he or she has a great zoom lens.\n \n I would also consider the horizon, as it usually becomes the midline section of a photo like this. When the sun is about to set, use a tripod to capture the ever-changing skyline and see what you like best. It should add interest to the image, not distract from it.

A photo from the car's rearview mirror can look really cool with the right angle and the right composition.\n \n In this case, the angle feels too cramped, and there are a lot of distracting elements that obscure the intended subject. Although, as it stands, the subject is also not clear here. Is it the backyard? Or is it the skeleton sticker?\n \n I think the first challenge here is to actually find an interesting subject. Since there's very little area to showcase, it's ideal to choose something expansive and not easily swallowed by all the other elements in the image. Basically, you're trying to frame a scene inside another scene.\n \n It's usually more impactful if it creates an iteration, like the sun setting reflected in an open road and also reflected alongside the bigger picture. It's also tricky to achieve that \"fits-the-whole-puzzle\" look, where the reflected image is part of the bigger image. This type of composition needs a lot of practice and experimentation, but that's also what makes it really fun!",

Although I like that it's not a totally clear reflection like most shots that incorporate this style. I like that it's more implied than a clear mirror image. It's subtle and suggestive.\n \n However, to achieve a clear reflection, make sure all your camera settings are correct. Usually, this type of photography uses a small aperture and a fast shutter speed. Another trick is to focus on the reflection in the water rather than the real subject. Usually, the camera already picks up the subject closest to it. So when you try to set your focus, set it to focus on the water instead, so it gives you more chances of having a clear reflection.\n \n I also suggest giving some breathing space on the right-hand side of this photo.

The more you look at it, the more they look like miniatures, maybe because it was shot from a top angle. Instead of the usual from-below shot, this one makes the buildings seem small and toy-like. I appreciate the creativity.\n \n Now, on to the execution. I find that the composition looks awkward. There seems to be a reversal here, as the foreground contains all the tall elements while the background is smaller and shorter. It's anticlimactic for the viewer.\n \n I also don't agree with where it's cropped, especially the bottom part of the image. There is no clear angle or framing that guides the eye to where the image starts and ends. It's just that the buildings are sprouting in a random manner.\n \n I think a portrait orientation could help narrow down the scope of this scene. It will also give some much-needed focus so that we see a more cohesive version. Choose which buildings to highlight in this scene.\n \n Make sure to enhance the sharpness and contrast so there is definition among the buildings. The light is a bit overexposed here, so that also needs some toning down. If it has to stay in landscape orientation, I suggest tilting the camera downwards to include more of the buildings' lower portion.",

Try to bounce it off a wall or ceiling to diffuse the light. You can also use a flash diffuser so it doesn't hit your subject in a harsh manner. Better yet, if there is ample natural light, just stick with that, especially if you are shooting people. If it's an event and you can set up a tripod, you can do that too. A tripod allows you to shoot with a slower shutter speed while keeping the camera steady.\n \n Also, if it's a solo photo like this one, a portrait orientation looks far more flattering, unless there's a reason to use a landscape orientation, such as highlighting another element within the scene.",

It's so cohesive and impactful!\n \n The curve of the subway escalator handle is a great leading line that guides our eyes throughout the scene. It's positioned so cleverly and highlights the dark and light areas of the image in a very seamless way.\n \n The scene is so balanced. The dark shadow area on the bottom left provides great contrast to the light area that fills almost three-fourths of the image. Even the two people descending the stairs add just the perfect amount of drama. They're a little blurred, like a motion blur, which is perfect.\n \n One comment I would have is that I wish the two people in the scene were slightly farther apart; then it would give this part a bit more definition than it has right now. They're a little too close together, but it's nothing major. \n \n Overall, a really great photograph!",

Why would a piece of furniture be left on the street like this? It doesn't look broken or dirty. It's right beside the dumpster, too.\n \n The composition is quite good, in my opinion. You know what the subject is right off the bat. There are glimpses of elements in the background that give context to what is happening in this scene. If I could edit a few things, I'd start with maybe muting or slightly blurring the dumpster, just to give the image more depth.

It makes the image pop in all the right ways. The low angle shot also makes them look tall and massive! I can also see the details of the cactus, the red spikes, and the curves and ridges.\n \n I think the photo would look even better if there was a bit of breathing room on the top and side of the image, just a little bit. Nothing crazy. I like how it was shot in portrait orientation. It's a tight shot, but it serves a purpose, which is to have all the attention on the cactus and highlight its height and texture.\n \n I suggest also adjusting the brightness just a tiny bit. It is slightly overexposed right now. It works just fine since it indicates the scorching heat of the sun, but a few tweaks would just make the photo more polished.",

You bet!\n \n This is a great example of how to capture the glaring golden sun without overpowering the scene. It's also a great example of how to avoid haze and lens flare. It's impressive how the photographer was able to filter the sun through the tree branches but still managed to give us a peek of mister golden sun. It's very clever and effective!\n \n The color and brightness are also spot on! I love how the reflection of the landscape turned out. Even the flying bird and its reflection give such charm to the whole scene.",

Try to create some distance from it, and ensure it's still in the upper part of the photo rather than melded into one of the buildings. It would also be more flattering if the sun were positioned in one of the corners.

Make sure your lens is set to a fast shutter speed and a wide aperture to let in more light. It takes a lot of practice to anticipate the peak moment of an action scene, so the old adage of practice, practice, practice goes a long way.\n \n To make this photo more powerful, I would crop or remove the distracting people in the background.

It looks natural, yet it flows. I like that there's lots of contrast, as some areas are darker while others are lighter in color. I can also trace the charming shapes of the leaves in the foreground.\n \n What I would do is mostly clean up the image.

Instead of a straightforward, front-facing shot, it's a clever idea to take a slightly side angle view of the image because it emphasizes how massive it is and also how intricate the architecture is.

The way it was framed is spot on; nothing looks abruptly cropped.\n \n What I find strange is the color. Obviously, it's edited into a muted gray color, most likely as a way to let the details pop.

I appreciate it was taken from a different angle, but I'm not sure it helped elevate the image at all.\n \n First, the image is overexposed. Though the sun looks gorgeous, it needed to be filtered a little bit more. A change in angle or perspective would perhaps crouch the sun beneath the tree branches instead of having it glare so harshly in the background. A few tweaks in the brightness would also help correct the overexposure.\n \n The pose is a matter of taste. I prefer more natural-looking captures between the betrothed couple.

There also appears to be a kind of lens flare, that shadowy, hazy light that casts the trees in the image. However, this kind of flare works fantastically for this image. It has beautifully captured how the sun's rays look when passing through a filtered section, such as when sunlight hits a sheer curtain.\n \n It's also impressive to see the trees reflected in the water, and the way the shadows of the rocks and possibly leaves scattered throughout the water look so striking.\n \n If I had to make a few tweaks here, I would expand the upper part of the photo where the sky is, just so there's a bit more breathing room for the image.

It's a wide shot of a beach scene, and it's a good choice to have it shot this wide.\n \n The wide shot works so well here because it gives the audience a snapshot of what it actually feels like to be at the beach. It's broad, and it has an unobstructed view of the horizon. The stillness of the waves lulls you, and there are many entities peppered all around.\n \n Here, the color of the setting sun in its last few minutes was captured beautifully. The pink, purple, and orange hues fill almost half the frame. I like how the lines on the sand pull you into the picture. I also love how the car's headlights in action were captured here ever so subtly.\n \n The composition is fantastic as it is. I also appreciate the straight midline section.

Have it function as a leading line, but in a broader way than the close-up shot it has now. Maybe a little zoom out would work here. The goal is to make it look slightly longer.\n \n The way the leaves cascade on the right side of the frame looks beautiful. It frames the image nicely. I wish the foreground had the same effect; even a slight indication of a leaf frame would immediately make the photo look more balanced.\n \n As a suggestion for other ways to highlight this place, I think it would be a good idea to find a focal point, or something that is not leaves, and make that pop out in the image amidst this scene. Because even though the greenery looks nice and pretty, it can get overwhelming in the image if there's no anchor for the viewer.",

There are many complementary lines and shapes here, from the curved canopy on the top floor to the way the rails and lines lead you to the most interesting detail of the building, which is the curved corners.

It makes the woman look soft and delicate.\n \n What I don't like is the yellow filter. This kind of color palette looks dated. It's saturated, and it's too warm. I think it would look better if the lighting looked more natural and unedited, but light and airy.",

It's a very realistic, wide shot of this beautiful landscape.\n \n Not much change here other than a few enhancements in the color and saturation.

However, the composition needs a bit more work.\n \n Right now, there are too many distracting elements in the background, such as the exposed pipes above, juxtaposed with the striped pink walls. There's nothing inherently wrong with including them in a photo, but I think it would look more polished if the shot did not include those annoying pipes in the top part of the room.\n \n Also, try to capture the two ladies in a more graceful stance, still mid-action, where they really look in sync or like they're mirroring each other. That significantly makes the photo more impactful. I love how bold the colors are between the walls and the dancers.\n \n One last thing is the lighting. Try not to create any more harsh lights on their faces. The shadows are fine so long as they are complementary or add depth and dimension to the photo.",

The low angle here is incredibly low, yet it also makes you want to see more.\n\nSince I can see the ground rise a little bit at the bottom edges of the photo, I wonder how low the photographer was when they took this photo. If I entertain it any further, it makes me think they were definitely almost underground.\n\nI also appreciate how they were able to filter the sun from the scene, yet still successfully utilize that sunlight in making this image look visually interesting.\n\nThe height of the flower plants looks amazing! They look so tall and wispy from this angle. The big flower on the right-hand side looks so amazing.\n\nThe composition also looks balanced, as the weight of the elements is distributed quite nicely.\n\nI would perhaps enhance the color of the sky here so it looks a tad more blue.",

The gradient is fantastic, the way it's filtered through the trees, giving way for fantastic shadows both up and down the scene.\n\nThe big, wide road also serves as an effective leading line that guides the viewer's gaze throughout the image.\n\nTo nitpick, I would probably crop the foreground just a little bit so the visual weight doesn't get too heavy in this area, but overall, it's a really powerful image!",

Outdoor shots in this very bright light require low ISO, a small aperture, and a fast shutter speed.

The details of the bird are defined, with its shadows and feathers clearly seen. However, upon closer inspection, the image needs more sharpening.

Consider shooting it lower than the current angle. This will make the top portion of the image bigger. This angle will also give a worm's eye view of the crane, making it prominent for dramatic effect.\n \n Second, the photo can remain as is, but the crop can be increased so the frame will be square.

The photo may look mundane at first glance, but the many details make this scene so intriguing, to say the least.\n \n It looks a bit like a prison cell or a mad person's bedroom. There's an old bed, random articles of clothing hanging by the bed, a chair with a towel on it, a tiny washbasin by the bedside, and even a statue at the head of the bed. There are all these different elements, but it's easy to accept that they all belong to the same scene.\n \n I think a more dramatic light would make this image even more striking.

All three of them are intent on watching the TV, glued to what looks like a cycling event. Upon closer inspection, this makes sense because, based on the bicycles around the room, this place is more or less a shop for bike riders.\n \n The use of black and white makes the photo look old and classic. It's like a cool photo from the past, though I doubt that's the case since the man on the table has an iPad.\n \n I also found it fascinating how the three people in the photo are placed in three different areas of the room, and all three are at different levels—one is standing, and the other two are sitting down but at different heights. They have covered all areas of the space, which divides the visual weight perfectly in this scene.\n \n I wouldn't change much in the photo. It looks great as it is.

The flowers look so pretty in this scene. There are bees sheltered below the flowers. It's such a poignant way to capture what could easily be a cliché scene.\n \n The colors look lovely! It's more on the warm side. I like the angle here, almost close to the ground.\n \n A good suggestion would be to position the flowers slightly to the right of the photo. I don't think the centered position looks great. I think a little off-center would feel more natural and balanced in a scene like this.",

The light just grazed her face in a very flattering manner. It's a side light, but there are no harsh shadows on her face.\n \n Composition-wise, I think this would be better in portrait orientation. I would also include a little bit more of her shoulders, revealing more of her blouse and gold necklace. I think the portrait orientation would also lengthen her face instead of widen it as in a landscape orientation.\n \n The background, though, looks a little fake. With how she is lit, I feel like this was shot in a studio. The background doesn't match that at all. I would prefer to see a more neutral background that connects with the type of lighting she actually has, which is a studio light.",

It's amazing how graceful the green branch sprouts in the opposite direction.\n \n As good as it looks, I think it would be even more interesting if there was more than one white flower. Since the flower looks so delicate, a group of them would look more striking. We can see there are a few more in the background that could be included in the image. Even one more white flower would elevate the scene.\n \n Since it's mostly a soft and airy photo, I would tweak the sharpness of the flower just a little bit—not overdone, just enough to give it more definition in contrast to the blurry background.

I could argue that it gives context to the size and length of these waves in contrast to how small the man looks. However, the placement is making the photo heavy and unbalanced.\n \n Surf photography can be really challenging because not only are you focused on the movement of the surfer, but you also have a lot of other natural elements to contend with, like the water, the waves, and the sun's natural lighting. But mostly, the waves. It takes a lot of practice to make sure you catch it at the right moment vis-a-vis the surfer riding the wave.\n \n Here, I think it would look so much better if we could see more of the green waters. Right now, everything is marred by the foams of the waves.\n \n The surfer is also positioned in the far right corner of the frame, almost out of the frame. Given how big the waves are, he is just swallowed by all the elements. He should be closer to the center of the image and would look so much better if he was on a more dynamic, balancing stance.",

From this angle, there is very little light, which means the photographer has to compensate with the camera settings, all while balancing the main scene, which is the one in between the rocks.\n \n The key here is to have better lighting within the area that you are shooting, in this case, in the foreground area.

It then creates these beautiful shadows, which nicely contrast the colorful hues of the sky at this time of day.\n \n The photographer was able to make the foreground shadows look visually balanced and interesting. The visual weight is evenly distributed. There's a higher, pointy tree that I can actually recognize. As far as I can see, it's a pine tree. It's taller than the rest. The other levels are shorter and have different patterned leaves.\n \n The colors are also gorgeous! I also appreciate how clean and clear the colors are presented. And finally, a hint of the moon up above, perfectly placed in the upper middle part of the image, is such a charming touch!\n \n I think this scene would also look fantastic in landscape orientation.

It starts in this deep green color, and the fog slowly shifts the whole texture of the image. It's such a nice contrast of bold versus barely there. I also notice how there's great variation in the green shade here. Some trees have a very deep green color, while others look lighter and even yellowish, which, again, is gorgeous to see!\n \n And the thing is, this is exactly how it looks in person when you are out in the mountains. If you hike, you know the fog gets heavier the higher you go. This particular instance is captured in this image in a very acute way.\n \n The only thing I would probably change is the size of the foreground. I would try to extend the green area a little bit more so it's a tad bigger than it is right now. This way, it feels more balanced because the hazy background occupies a larger portion of the frame.",

The sunlight is reflected on the white umbrellas and the conical hats. Second, the frame is filled to the brim! It is crowded and narrow and incredibly busy. And third, the two colorful canopies on the top part of the image work well in framing this scene.\n \n If I had to change something here, I would probably zoom the camera out just a tiny bit. The scene looks perfect to me right now; however, I think a little breathing space around the edges of the photo would look fabulous. It'll give the photo some negative space, which is a respite from the hectic market scene. This goes for both the right and left sides, as well as the bottom or foreground. Just a little space to polish the whole composition.",

The black color also features some great specular highlights that make it look chic and, as I said, expensive.\n \n What I would edit here a little bit is the background. It's good that the background is mostly a neutral white color. However, a little blur would definitely make the car stand out in the foreground. I would also extend the sides a little bit.

The way the women are positioned together creates a narrative that speaks to their shared experiences and the journey they are on.\n \n Since the sky is also a predominant element, I think it would enhance the image to have the sky in a bolder blue color. It adds to the positive feel of the image. As interesting as this low angle is, I just find myself wanting to see more of the women. Why not get a higher angle? You can still employ the rock as a framing device, but it doesn't have to be this low. Make the rock smaller and the women bigger. To see a glimpse of their facial expressions would definitely make this photo ten times better.",

The sun shouldn't look this harsh.\n \n Apart from adjusting this in post, it's important to know how to avoid this when shooting. You can simply use a lens hood to block the overpowering rays of the sun when shooting. This also limits possible lens flare, which is basically excess light that reflects and scatters inside the camera and bounces back into the image.\n \n It wouldn't hurt to dial back the brightness and warmth of the photo.

Her silver blonde hair makes her look even more cold and menacing. If that's the goal here, then kudos, as that's how I perceive this photo.\n\nHer skin color looks flattering on her, though. There are no annoying shadows, which gives full attention to the makeup—the foundation, the lipstick, the eyeliner, and mascara.\n\nHowever, I am bothered by how much this tight shot elongates her face. It makes her look more oblong than she should. Maybe a slight angle to the side would help alleviate this. Instead of a straight shot, why not angle the face a little so it cuts the frame and takes away attention from the full length of her face? Also, it would be a good idea to include more of her hair from the side. It will widen the view rather than elongate it.",

I appreciate how the photographer was able to capture the gorgeous rays of the sun in a way that doesn't look too hard or harsh.\n\nIf you look closely, you'll see the sun is already hiding behind one of the clouds. This is great because we now see the filtered version of these rays.\n\nAs for the clouds, I love how dimensional they look, thanks to the well-placed shadows around them. It almost looks like they're moving, just as they do in real life.\n\nWhat I would change here is the proportion between the water and the sky. Though I can understand why the water looks bigger here than the sky—possibly because the photographer wanted to highlight the expanse of the water—I think it should be the other way around.\n\nThe sky should fill the frame more; therefore, I would crop a little bit of the foreground here.

For something this small and low, it's a bit of a challenge to photograph because you have to get down there too. It would also be great if you have a capable lens that can capture the details of small subjects.\n\nBut for starters, I think a side view would work just fine for this scene. It will give a better view of the length and the canopy of the mushroom.\n\nIt's great that there are a number of mushrooms present within the area.

He's obviously in the middle of a performance, so the least we could expect is some implication of movement and dimension, thanks to the way the shadows create some depth in the image.\n\nHowever, it's not really a flattering shot overall. The microphone completely blocks his mouth, and we cannot see his right arm. There are multiple light sources in this photo, which is why the overall effect looks scattered.\n\nI would prefer to shoot this in landscape format so there is more space for the other elements to contextualize the main subject. It would be great to see more of his stance and his stage presence. I would also adjust the brightness of this photo, especially around the face area. I don't intend to make it super bright, just enough to soften the shadows a little, while maintaining some form of depth.",

Not only does it prevent the stark light from ruining the scene, but it also creates soft shadows that look really pretty filtered through these colored fabrics.\n\nI would, however, step back a little bit here. Maybe position the chairs to the right side so we can have some breathing room from all the delightful colors. Some form of negative space to the left would look perfect.

I find it overdone, saturation-wise.\n\nIt's too bad because the composition is actually perfect. This angle makes the car look huge and shows its best features. It's a great vantage point. It fills the frame just right, leaving enough space on the left and right sides so it's a little bit isolated as the main subject.\n\nSince it's in black and white, I get why there's a need for saturation. Not only does it emphasize the lines and shapes in the car, but it also gives it a vintage look. But perhaps not at this level of saturation. I would dial this way down. I'd still go for bold blacks and whites, but I would do that in the highlights and the shadows, not in the color and clarity itself.\n\nThis should still be bold and vibrant, but just a notch down from what it is right now.",

It's the way the elements contribute to making the photo look ethereal under such soft lighting.\n\nIt's really gorgeous to see the leaves underneath the water. It gives the photo a lot of depth. The branches of this water plant look like delicate strokes that show a lot of gracefulness. Plus, the way the light reflects on the water makes it look so ethereal. It strides the line between totally poetic or totally vague.\n\nI would enhance the colors here even more. My goal is not to make it harsh looking, just adjust the greens and the yellows a little bit so they look slightly more pronounced. I would also play around with the light and try to lessen the brightness and see if it enhances the shadows even more.\n\nI really like this image as vague as it may be.",

I understand it gives the tall tower more room to be showcased, but since it's already a wide shot, you can definitely accommodate the height of this tower in a landscape orientation.\n\nThe reason I feel like this would work better in landscape is that there are other elements in the photo that give context to this very tall structure. A horizontal view would give more space to fully accommodate the scene.\n\nTake, for example, the green pool in the foreground. It would look so much better if it was extended, filling the frame from end to end. Since the buildings are in somber colors, this pop of green actually works well to contrast the dullness. It also gives the image a better framework so it looks like the visual weight is evenly distributed.",

We can clearly see the beauty of his eyes, beak, and feathers. I love how we see the pattern and vibrant color of his feathers. The background melds into a creamy blur that perfectly accentuates the main subject.\n\nIt's actually pretty perfect as it is. If I had to redo this image, I would perhaps shoot the bird in portrait orientation and include the rest of his body, probably in a wider shot that also establishes its natural habitat.

Even the kids playing around the plaza are interesting to photograph.\n\nBut for a static image like this, it's the details that matter.

The wispy branches in the foreground and on the side of the frame don't really hold much visual interest; they look random. The two white dots in the middle look like stars, but I'm not even sure if they are.\n\nThe photo needs a different perspective. I think the shape and pattern of the tree on the right side looks more interesting than anything in this photo. I suggest making that the subject of the photo instead. Check if it has enough branches to create a wide shot with the sky in the background. It would be better if it were around the golden hour when the sun looks the most dramatic. That would probably give very interesting light and shadow that you could play with against the wispy, bare trees.\n\nMake sure to use the right camera settings depending on the light you have. If it's still bright outside, use a low ISO, fast shutter speed, and small aperture. This is just a guideline, though, as it really changes depending on the scene. This is just to make sure you actually take sharp images when you shoot because a blurry photo is almost no photo at all.",

A little mystery is also a powerful story.\n\nAlthough, I have to say, the middle part of this image has some deep shadows that bring so much depth to the scene. I love how the foreground features short, stiff, brown grasses, and as you progress further into the picture, you get another level of greenery—this time, much taller and greener pine trees. Everything looks great up until this point. Then the level halts. Your eyes would love to see another level up from this progression, and that, I think, is where the photo needs work.\n\nI think it would be a good idea to shoot it from a higher point of view. That way, we get to include the scene in the background. I think the levels work wonderfully here, but the last part should have been the mountains hovering above.\n\nIf there's no way to get to a higher angle, any element that would rise above the mountains would make this scene a bit more balanced.

It's nicely positioned in the left-hand corner of the frame, which is a great position to give it a balanced look.\n\nFor film photography, we rely on the camera settings alone and have no chance to see the product as we shoot. It's important to take note of your film's ISO because there's only so much you can adjust, depending on the film camera you're using.\n\nAs a standard rule, when shooting a very bright image outdoors, you can get away with a lower ISO, like in this scene. However, you should make sure that it also works well with your aperture and shutter speed. A very fast shutter speed with a small aperture will let a very small amount of light in. Try to familiarize yourself with the film camera's light meter to ensure your photo will be properly exposed.\n\nThere is some charm to vintage, hazy photos.

The straight wooden plank immediately leads the eye to the center of the image, and it's a very clean line.\n\nThe photographer has employed some HDR editing, which makes the details extra sharp and saturated. The sun is beautifully placed on the right side of the image, and the clouds—look at those clouds—are perfectly scattered in these perfect cumulus shapes.\n\nThen there's the yellow handrail and the mini house in the water. Both are flushed to the left-hand side of the image, which slightly makes it look uneven. It's quite stark, given it's in a bright yellow color. I don't think adding a similar one to the right side would help the photo; I think it would make it too cluttered and heavy. This asymmetry is looking really good the more you look at it. It's surprising and unconventional, but at the same time, the free space is a welcome reprieve for the image.\n\nJust for fun, I think without the yellow handrail, the photo becomes much more quiet.

Try to balance it with cooler tones so the real color will pop out.\n\nAs for the composition, the image lacks a clear focal point. Is it the floating house on the left? Is it the water? The buildings? They look a little cluttered right now, especially since all of them are in focus.\n\nIt's most likely the floating house on the left.

The size of the bee in contrast to the whole frame is just perfect. You can see the bulging eyes, the wings, and even the hairy parts of its body. It gives me the shivers.\n\nThe tight shot is perfectly composed, with the bee and the flower occupying the right side of the frame in an almost slanting manner that's visually pleasing with the way it's angled in the flower. The blurred background is also spot on. It makes the subject stand out even more.\n\nIf I could nitpick, maybe I would adjust the shadows a little bit and make them a tad deeper. I think it would help give more depth to these areas of the photo.\n\nOtherwise, it's a perfect image!",

It doesn't have to be dead center, since the way the right mountain shows the slope gives the overall image great depth and dimension. We just need to see more of the subject.\n\nAs is, it looks dull, probably because of the color and the lighting. The light here looks one-note, and the skies are blurred out by a fog. There's also an attempt at a foreground frame, but it suddenly stops halfway.\n\nOnce the composition is adjusted, I think this photo needs to dial down its exposure.

It's basically in threes, not at all symmetrical, and that's why it works!\n\nThe colors are also not exaggerated. It looks natural but still vivid and vibrant. The brightness, though I personally like it the way it is, can be dialed down just a teeny bit. It's a little too bright right now.

Since it's a scene, more than focusing on one area, it should be framed perfectly.\n\nA little zoom out would do wonders here. Give the foreground a bit more space, and the same with the sides. Give the middle, white part of the park more emphasis by framing it using the elements in the background. Include that one last chair in the middle a little bit more. Better yet, if you find a horizontal line, like a fence, that would frame the lower portion of this image, that would make it more compelling. The photo is also tilted to the right side. I would straighten that out so it looks more even-keeled.\n\nThen, on to the colors. Since there are a few beautiful yellow and red-colored trees around, why not make them pop more? Adjust the color and contrast so they accentuate the scene more. These tree colors remind people of the fall season, and that would be a nice feeling to anchor the scene to.",

Instead of a crystal-clear closeup of this bee in action, what we have is a cluttered image with the elements almost there, but not quite.\n\nI think the camera settings here play a huge part, as well as the distance of the lens to the subject. If you have a very wide aperture and are close to the subject, there's a tendency for the focused part to become way too small, and the blurry part emanates throughout the rest of the scene. It's important to find that balance of a classic bokeh shot, but in this case, in macro photography.\n\nThe flower should also be more defined here. Right now, all we see in the frame are its petals, with no other parts that would make it look more sharp and multi-dimensional.\n\nThe bee should be the main focus and should be a bit isolated from the rest of the elements in the photo, including the flower. Try to capture it when it's not in a similar pattern or stance as the flowers, so there is a clear definition of what the subject is.",

The color of her dress and the pink roses she's holding look incredibly pretty overall. I also noticed the stark contrast between her and the background. While she looks young, dainty, and feminine, the background is the opposite. It looks old, chaotic, and dilapidated. Together, they look mismatched in a sense.\n\nThis could go both ways, as opposites have a certain kind of tension. But in this case, it could border on eerie because why would someone as pristine as her be in such a rundown location?\n\nOn the technical side, the image looks sharp and the colors are vibrant. I think it's fine that her legs are cropped in this scene as it gives the illusion of length.\n\nI wouldn't really change much here except for the tint of her skin.

There were probably a lot of light sources when this shot was taken, which isn't surprising since it looks like they're at home. If they have cool lights in the area, like a fluorescent light, the camera automatically compensates for that and changes it into a warm color. That's why it's very important to adjust your camera settings depending on the available light you have when shooting.\n\nThe sharpness may have also been affected by the low light situation indoors. This could be fixed by amping up your ISO, widening your aperture, and slowing down your shutter speed, depending on how much light you actually have. That's why for low light situations, it's best if you use a tripod so you'll have more leeway for a brighter and clearer exposure.",

The photographer was able to perfectly execute this concept of shooting from a dark room that directly faces a small door and using it as a frame for the subject of the photo. In this case, it's a woman smiling.\n\nThe stark, dark shadows bring such a gorgeous effect to the light, rectangular door that contains the proper light to showcase a subject. I also like the light reflecting a few steps from the door and further changing into a pitch-black color the farther away it gets. It shows such nice depth.\n\nI think in order to make this photo better, I would consider cropping it so that the focal point would look bigger; therefore, the door and the subject would be closer and bigger.

        "comment": "Apparently, this is Mount Starr King, a granite dome in Yosemite, California. I had to look it up because I have never seen anything like it.\n\nIt's a fantastic view based on this photograph. This vantage point captures the dome perfectly. This wide shot gives an unobstructed view of this unique land formation. The composition is spot on. I wouldn't change a thing about it.\n\nNow, on to the colors and the contrast. The colors right now look too flat and one-note. It's mostly varying shades of blue and gray. The green trees just meld into the background. The color just doesn't look engaging. The same goes for the contrast. The sky and the dome are of the same intensity color and saturation-wise. Therefore, the overall impact is not that compelling.\n\nI think adjustments to the saturation, contrast, and colors should be made. Make the greens and the blues a little bolder. The gray area, the granite area, can be lightened a little bit. It needs to stand out against the deep dark greens of the trees and the deep blue sky. The end goal is to make the colors a lot bolder so the overall image doesn't look washed out.",

For this particular image, the exaggerated colors and definition look great because it fits the subject perfectly. The subject here is this very lush group of trees, plants, and foliage. The HDR edit perfectly accentuates how rich and verdant this scene should be. It's perfect! That's exactly what I see here!\n\nI also like the diagonal way that the plants are lined up. It makes the overall scene more balanced and more interesting rather than a one-level height. The senses are enticed on several levels—the colors, the size, the patterns, the height; even the shadows in between look fantastic and give so much heft to the image.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the sky is slightly less saturated compared to the rest of the scene. It's actually a great contrast, so there is definitely a stress on the main subject of the image.\n\nI wouldn't change much here except for maybe slightly dialing down the brightness.",

Right now, it's the other way around.\n\nSecond, try to find a visually pleasing angle for the buildings. Line them up in such a way that gives a sense of balance and variety. Don't just clump them together. Choose the best spot to include.\n\nFinally, make sure the light is present. We can definitely lighten this in post, but as a photography principle, it's always about the light first and foremost. Make sure the subject is lit well, not necessarily bright, but illuminated in the most interesting way possible.

The image is also clear and sharp, with the background blurred out, which appropriately highlights the dog.\n\nI think this would look better in portrait orientation. The side view is great, but it would look even better if we could see a bit of her torso. She has such gorgeous fur. It would be nice to see it fill the frame in cascading shades of beige and brown.\n\nI would remove the green plant behind her.

The way it pierces through the foliage reminds me of summer afternoons, and this particular light was captured quite nicely here.\n\nI particularly appreciate the shadows at the lower left portion of the scene. It's such a dynamic effect, and it makes the swamp look more alive and real. There is a distinction between the parts that were hit directly by the golden light and the parts that remained dark and shadowy because of that same light.\n\nI think my main issue here is the wideness of the shot. As it stands right now, it can get a little too chaotic and busy. It's too wide.\n\nI would probably crop this image, cutting mostly the scene on the left since it's already a bit of a stretch right now.

I would have preferred it to be shot a little tighter, or simply to crop the gray foreground a bit right before the stairs. The symmetry works here because the building itself has a symmetrical design. It’s effective to have the tall facade in the middle of the photo, with a slightly lower angle, to emphasize its height and grandeur.\n \n What would make this photo stand out more are some tweaks in the contrast and saturation of the colors. The details and the outline are already there. The image is also clear and sharp. Making the colors bolder and the lines more pronounced—the blue sky, the grayish silver facade, and the orange door—would greatly improve the overall impact. This might even look cool as a black and white photo since the lines, patterns, and shadows would look heightened in a monochrome color palette.",

He could be riding his motorbike or standing beside it, but with a side view of the bike instead of the back view like we have right now.\n \n Also, the light is too dark here; it doesn't highlight his features.

It should just be timed better, meaning the musicians should be captured when all three of them are visible in the shot. Even better if they are doing different things, say, for example, one is using the mic, the other is playing the guitar, and another is working the crowd—anything that indicates variation and dynamic movement.

Suffice it to say, the branches look good as a supporting element to the subject.\n \n What I would focus on here is polishing the image. The exposure looks too dark, even though that is the theme.

The main leading line is the water. The way it juts out of the frame from the bottom left to the middle of the image guides the eye through the scenery.\n\nI'm also impressed by the shadows of the rock formations in the middle of the photo. It looks real and multidimensional. The colors are also true to life, not overdone or oversaturated. Just a great landscape capture!\n\nWhat I don't get is the woman in the foreground. Her fabulous pink hair is distracting to an otherwise perfect scene. She almost looks photoshopped in. Personally, I don't mind if she was cropped out of the photo. But if she must stay, at least make her less distracting, maybe with her back to the viewer, more of a silhouette appreciating the scenery. But really, she needs to be cropped out of the photo.",

The colors look dark and muddled. Her face is also blurry, almost hazy. She's wearing this pretty dress, but it's not doing her any favors because the colors are just so dull and flat.\n\nWhen shooting indoors, it's important to situate the subject where there is natural light. Any window will do. You can experiment with many directions, like side or front lighting. Back lighting has its own effects, but usually, for portraits, it's side or front light. The goal is to give the model the best possible light so their features shine in the photo.\n\nIf there's no natural light, you can use an artificial light to do the same, but make sure it has filters so the light looks soft, not harsh.\n\nTry to also isolate the subject from the background by using a shallow depth of field. Good portrait photos have a focused, sharp subject and a creamy, blurry background.\n\nTo salvage this photo, maybe try to brighten the subject and adjust the colors and saturation so there will be some. The purple dress should look purple, not off-white.",

However, because the background is too dark and the cat’s fur is also partly dark, they both meld together, making the cat look less defined and, thus, less compelling.\n\nHowever, I can also see a different concept here. Maybe the photographer was trying to capture a dark background so the cat did meld into the background, almost like it's floating, but with a few other intriguing features, like the white part of his fur and his black birthmark, standing out of the frame.\n\nIf that's the case, then the background should be almost completely dark, and therefore the slightly blue tinge in the background should be blurred out as well. It should look like he is coming out of a blackout.\n\nIf that's also the concept, it would be nice to have his eyes look more striking, with more contrast than the rest of the image.

However, the cute toddlers in the foreground are visible, but also very dimly lit. It gives me the impression that the photographer may have wanted to really capture their faces or was going for a silhouette composition. Basically, neither was achieved in this photo.\n \n This type of lighting actually affords a lot of interesting shots if you just play around with it. I can imagine just going for a classic silhouette shot in this case where the two little kids are present in the frame but ideally in a dynamic pose, e.g., running after each other, doing a jump shot, playing around, etc. The angle will be a front angle either from a low or eye-level shot. The goal is just to get their silhouette against the glistening golden sun in the background.\n \n Another option would be to really use the sun to illuminate their faces, which means photographing them diagonally where they are lit through the side of their face. We can then include the length of the shoreline with the horizon to their right.\n \n Whichever it is, it's about committing to how to use this gorgeous light. Right now, they aren't positioned in a visually balanced way, and the kid on the right is barely recognizable with no definition whatsoever.

It definitely looks off-center, but the way the buildings are lined up makes for a solid photo. It's skewed, but it's arranged skewed—organized chaos, in a sense.\n \n Although it does look chaotic, I think it's justified with what the scene is trying to portray. There are numerous fighter jets flying about in this busy skyline. The diagonal horizon gives that feeling of rush and disorientation, which is apt with the whole theme of the photo.\n \n But if we had to edit this, I would shorten the clear blue sky just a little. It's just too wide right now, especially since the bottom elements are all crammed at the bottom. The horizon can still be straightened out to give a more traditional skyline view. We definitely need to see more of the green waters with the boats on it, as it gives a sense of balance from the sky and the heaviness of the buildings.\n \n It would be nice if the steam lines coming out of the jets were more pronounced and more present in all the other jets.

The rock in the background looks immense as a focal point, and the grass and flowers in the foreground have so much depth and dimension that they look very realistic as a whole.\n \n The colors of the foreground are gorgeous! There are so many textures on display, and the way they are spaced out looks so balanced and visually pleasing. The points of interest are evenly distributed, even if it's not an obvious symmetry, which is even more fantastic.\n \n The only comment I have is about the definition of the sky and the horizon. It's not too bad, but it does look a bit washed out. I would slightly adjust the brightness here and dial up the contrast and see if it helps define the sky against the big boulder in the middle.\n \n Otherwise, a great landscape photo!",

        "comment": "I love the serene colors in this landscape photo, especially the blue sky. There is something so accurate and delicate about this particular blue that's captured here. It's that exact kind of blue that you'll associate with winter weather.\n \n As much as the background looks impeccable, I find the foreground to be too busy. Not only is it busy, but the bare branches that poke out of the sides of the frame look too stiff and frail to have any appeal. The pine trees scattered in the center of the image look clumped together in a way that looks heavy and clustered.\n \n I think this image would have looked better if the foreground wasn't so busy. The clustered pine trees just look unappealing. Maybe there is a different angle where they look more evenly scattered rather than clumped.\n \n I would also remove the side branches here, as they just look distracting. Unless it gives a softer, more curtain-like shape, it will just look awkward as a framing device for this image.",

It wouldn't be so bad if the color and contrast looked interesting, but that's not the case. It's a plain photo of a highway, period.\n \n What would have worked here is definition. Since there's no view to speak of, why not focus on defining the lines of the side road and the yellow road signs?

As you go farther into the image, there are tall and taller pine trees in the middle. Finally, there's the silhouette of the mountains in the background. The eyes gradually follow this sequential increase in height. It's also a great way to showcase everything in the photo in a more balanced way.\n \n However, the sharpness and the colors here are blurred and bland, respectively. The details look murky without even having to zoom out. It's important to make sure you use the right camera settings depending on the scene you want to shoot.

The scene is divided into two sections: the left part includes the clear image of a man sitting inside the bus, while the right part of the image shows a blurred capture of the outside of another bus. There’s a yin and yang to it, but the execution isn’t quite there yet.\n \n First, the motion blur for the bus on the right needs more work. I think there should have been more space there so the motion blur looks more defined and isolated. Right now, this other bus is too close. Still, the motion blur could be improved. It’s a really challenging thing to shoot, especially if you’re in a moving bus because you have to use a slower shutter speed.\n \n Second, the left part of the image could use more definition as well.

I like the defined shapes of the distant clouds; they add depth and dimension to the image. The blue tone throughout the image contributes to a cool and tranquil vibe.\n \n I also find the ripples in the water to be quite impressive. It would have been great to see more of these ripples, especially in the middle part of the water area. If that were the case, the large portion of the foreground would be justifiable.\n \n But as it stands, the visual weight is a bit off. There is too much water in the foreground, but the sky and the horizon look too short.\n \n I think the composition should include a good amount of water, ideally with the ripples more visible, and the trees and sky section need to be extended a little bit to create a more balanced image.\n \n Additionally, the distant trees could use a bit more definition rather than just seeing a dark area in the midline section.
