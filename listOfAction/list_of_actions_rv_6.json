The green foliage relaxes the eyes, along with the shadows of the surrounding buildings. Compared to the brightly lit buildings on the other side, one can feel the coolness of the scene and relax in the shade. Normally, a shot with too many tourists can ruin a scene, but this shot makes it work, as the travelers walking around the pathway provide a sense of scale to the place.\n \n The photo already has excellent dynamic range, with the lights toned down and the shadows lifted to balance the scene.

The pose looks relaxed, but since it's taken from below, the perspective shows more of her chin while also making her behind appear a bit bigger. The lighting in that area is also lacking; the shade doesn't give enough light to her face, and looking downward makes it worse.\n \n Recommendations are as follows:\n \n 1. Angle her head to look a bit more toward the sky. This will light up her face more and reduce the double chin.\n 2. Her left hand is resting flatly on her hip. Have her open or bend her fingers more so it doesn't appear massive.\n 3. Her right hand is much too lit by the sun. Ask her to lower that hand a bit so it won't be overexposed.\n Optionally, the photographer can also shoot on top of a stool or ladder, so the model won't have to angle her head.",

It's hard to go wrong in a place like this, as it's filled with aesthetic elements. The only complaint, though, is the soft features of the structure.

There is a watermark to the left of the screen that leaves a shadow.\n \n The technique being applied here appears to be long exposure photography coupled with flash. The long exposure should capture the movement, although in this case, barely, while the in-camera flash freezes the main subject to finish the photo. It's recommended to use off-camera flash (with the use of remote triggers) so that it won't look like a 90's camera shot, unless that was the intent.",

The sky looks almost like a rainbow with its vibrant hues of blue, red, green, and yellow.

There was also an attempt to lift the already black details of the bridge—possibly to reveal the graffiti—making it less contrasty and unnatural.\n\nTo make the graffiti visible with the bridge and sky details, it's recommended to shoot this frame a few minutes later when the sun drops down enough so that the sky is no longer too bright for a long exposure shot. The sky then would no longer have blown out highlights, details of the darks would be lifted up, and you get vibrant sunset colors without the use of HDR as a bonus.",
